In **Modern Warfare (2019)**, Infinity Ward introduced a new approach to weapon ballistics, incorporating bullet trajectory into the gameplay. Art director Joel Emslie explained that players would need to consider bullet drop and, in some cases, windage when firing designated marksman rifles (DMRs) or sniper rifles.

However, in the 2019 release, *Call of Duty: Modern Warfare*, Infinity Ward incorporated bullet drop into the campaign mode, particularly for designated marksman rifles (DMRs) and sniper rifles.
