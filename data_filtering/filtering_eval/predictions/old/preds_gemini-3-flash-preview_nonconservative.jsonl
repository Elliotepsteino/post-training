{"id": "11", "model": "gemini-3-flash-preview", "pred_year": 2006, "gold_year": 2010, "bucket": 4, "label": "Gold answer is wrong", "rationale": "The gold year (2010) appears incorrect for the entity 'fio (Flexible I/O Tester)'. Public evidence (project repo and commit history) shows fio existed in the mid-2000s (initial commit and early releases around 2006), so the model's earlier estimate reflects that. The model is non-conservative only because the gold label is later than the actual origin date."}

The gold year (2015) appears to reflect a page update or metadata date rather than the feature introduction, so the model predicting an earlier year is due to the gold answer being incorrect."}
