We study temporal grounding, the task of predicting the earliest year when a text sample could be produced without relying on unavailable knowledge.
We introduce a multi-agent pipeline that extracts time-anchored entities, grounds them with web evidence, and aggregates conservative year estimates.
We evaluate the approach on dev and test sets sampled from Tulu-3 and annotated by humans, and we apply the pipeline to build a large time-grounded post-training dataset.
