We study temporal grounding, the task of predicting the earliest year when a text sample could be produced without relying on unavailable knowledge.
We introduce a multi-agent pipeline that extracts time-anchored entities, grounds them with web evidence, and aggregates conservative year estimates.
We introduce an evaluation suite based on human-annotated samples from Tulu-3 to measure the efficiency of the approach and compare against several baselines.
We then demonstrate scalability by applying the pipeline to a large subset of the Tulu-3 SFT, RLVR, and DPO datasets.
