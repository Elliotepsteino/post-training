This edition delineated the Southern Ocean by land-based boundaries: Antarctica to the south, and the continents of South America, Africa, Australia, and New Zealand to the north. The specific delineation included:\n\n- From Cape Horn in Chile eastward to Cape Agulhas in Africa.\n- Then further eastward to the southern coast of mainland Australia to Cape Leeuwin, Western Australia.\n- From Cape Leeuwin, the limit followed eastward along the coast of mainland Australia to Cape Otway, Victoria.\n- Then southward across Bass Strait to Cape Wickham, King Island, along the west coast of King Island, then south across Bass Strait to Cape Grim, Tasmania.\n- The limit then followed the west coast of Tasmania southward to the South East Cape and then went eastward to Broughton Island, New Zealand, before returning to Cape Horn.\n\nIn the 1937 second edition, the IHO moved the northern limits of the Southern Ocean southward, extending from Antarctica northward to latitude 40°S between Cape Agulhas in Africa (long. 20°E) and Cape Leeuwin in Western Australia (long. 115°E), and extending to latitude 55°S between Auckland Island of New Zealand (165 or 166°E east) and Cape Horn in South America (67°W).\n\nHowever, in the 1953 third edition, the IHO omitted the Southern Ocean from its official publication, leaving its definition to local hydrographic offices. The IHO readdressed the question of the Southern Ocean in a survey in 2000. Of its 68 member nations, 28 responded, and all responding members except Argentina agreed to redefine the ocean, reflecting the importance placed by oceanographers on ocean currents. The proposal for the name Southern Ocean won 18 votes, beating the alternative Antarctic Ocean. Half of the votes supported a definition of the ocean's northern limit at the 60th parallel south—with no land interruptions at this latitude—with the other 14 votes cast for other definitions, mostly the 50th parallel south, but a few for as far north as the 35th parallel south. ([en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southern_Ocean?utm_source=openai))\n\nA draft fourth edition of the *Limits of Oceans and Seas* was circulated to IHO member states in August 2002, but it has not been formally adopted due to ongoing discussions and disagreements among member states. As of January 2026, the IHO has not officially recognized the Southern Ocean as a distinct ocean. However, in April 2023, the IHO Assembly approved a resolution recognizing the Southern Ocean as the global sea area surrounding the continent of Antarctica, with its northern limit defined by the parallel of latitude 60°S. This resolution aligns with the previously proposed definition but does not alter the official status of the Southern Ocean within the IHO's publications.
