\section{Discussion}
Two observations stand out: Gemini 3 Flash performs better than Gemini 3 Pro, and GPT-5-mini is similar to GPT-5.2.
It would be valuable to explore whether this stems from smaller models producing more conservative intervals and from the asymmetric risk profile that penalizes underestimates more than overestimates.
