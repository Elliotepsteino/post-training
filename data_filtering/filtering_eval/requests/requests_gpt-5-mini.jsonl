Return JSON exactly as: {\"year\": 2001}."}, {"role": "user", "content": "The next chapter should also be interesting, lengthy and action-packed with plenty of dialogue and exposition, with the plot consisting of the below information:\n\nAs Bolan as the Executioner brings fear to Los Angeles\u2019 criminal underworld, Chris, the sandy-haired, green-eyed heir to the wealthy Thorndyke family, is grappling with the aftermath of defeating the nefarious Dr. Eggman. During the final battle, Chris and his closest friend Sonic merged, altering the universe and erasing the mad scientist from existence. However, this also meant that Sonic and his friends no longer had a reason to visit Earth, leaving Chris as the sole bearer of memories from their previous adventures. Despite his vast inheritance and upbringing, Chris is an outcast at school and struggles with depression, all while attempting to master the immense powers he gained from merging with Sonic. The unfolding narrative persists, leading us to the remarkable revelation from Chris\u2019 eccentric grandfather, Charles \u201cChuck\u201d Thorndyke. Despite his advanced age, his mind remains astute and vibrant. He unveils to the astonished young man an ancestral matrimonial agreement, penned by a youthful Charles, with the esteemed heads of the Clocktower Association of magi, headquartered in London, England. As a consequence, Chris is destined to meet his future wives and betrothed, who will be coming from Japan to visit their future husband. Among them is a formidable and loyal samurai nekomimi [monster cat girl] as well as a trainee kunoichi, embodying charm and grace with her captivating black hair, mesmerizing purple eyes, and ample assets\u2014Akiyama \u201cHimari Noihara\u201d Rinko. Furthermore, we encounter the resolute and spirited heiress of the Tohsaka clan of magi, recognized as the Mizuki clan of shinobi, who also possess noble lineage in the mortal realm. Her name is Tohsaka Rin, also known as Yukikaze Mizuki, a striking brunette with enchanting blue eyes. Accompanying her is Rin\u2019s demure yet determined younger sister, the alluring Sakura Matou, distinguished by her lustrous purple locks and captivating purple eyes, surpassing even her sister in physical allure. Moreover, we encounter the twin heiresses of the esteemed German Einzbern clan of magi. One is a reticent and bashful young lady, adorned with silver hair and piercing red eyes, possessing a petite frame accentuated by a generous bosom\u2014Illyasivel von Einzbern. The other twin, Illya\u2019s fraternal counterpart, exudes boundless energy and contagious excitement, complemented by her vibrant amber eyes and lively pink hair\u2014Chloe von Einzbern. At long last, the roster of prospective partners is graced by none other than Rin\u2019s longstanding adversary at the prestigious Clocktower, Luvia Edelfelt. A bewitching mage in her own right, Luvia possesses a mesmerizing beauty with twin tails of lustrous blonde hair and piercing blue eyes. Hailing from a distinguished German magical lineage akin to the esteemed Einzberns, Luvia is accompanied by her young prot\u00e9g\u00e9, Miyu Edelfelt. With her ebony locks and amber gaze, Miyu exudes an air of quiet contemplation. Additionally, we are presented with the captivating figure of Reines El-Melloi Archisorte, a diminutive yet striking presence in the realm of magic. With her golden locks cascading and azure eyes sparkling, Reines\u2019 confidence and self-assuredness stem from her illustrious lineage, firmly establishing her family as revered pillars within the Clocktower hierarchy.\n\nSakura goes by the name Hana Umezono in the human world, while Illya goes by the name Sagiri Izumi, Chloe uses the name Megumi Jinno and Reines uses the alias Emily Granger.\n\nUpon the girls\u2019 arrival in Japanese America, after departing from the Tohsaka/Mizuki and Matou stronghold in the quaint Japanese city of Fuyuki, they are taken aback to discover that Chris is completely oblivious to the existence of magic and the supernatural, as well as his own engagement, until Chuck enlightens him. However, Chris\u2019s innate kindness and empathy manage to soften the hearts of even the most arrogant, namely Reines/Emily and Luvia, as they gradually acquaint themselves with one another. Notably, Rinko/\u201cHimari\u201d and Chris find common ground in their shared passion for martial arts and swordplay, forging a special bond. Remarkably, Chris\u2019s swiftness, inherited from Sonic, leaves a lasting impression on the unwavering samurai ninja cat girl, though he chooses to conceal the truth about his recent past from both his beloveds and his family. Illya, Miyu, and Chloe/\u201cMegumi\u201d begin to perceive Chris not only as their future husband but also as a cherished older brother. Additionally, Reines finds herself astounded by Chris\u2019s literary knowledge and his remarkable reasoning skills displayed during their conversations. Conversely, Luvia is captivated by Chris\u2019s analytical mind and unwavering determination. As time progresses, the connection between Chris and his fianc\u00e9es deepens, evolving into a profound bond of mutual affection, gradually eradicating Chris\u2019s melancholy.\n\nThe chapter concludes with Bolan gracefully perched on a nearby tree, observing Chris and his future wives as they gracefully enter a meticulously crafted limousine, destined for a luxurious rendezvous in the most prestigious destinations of the City of Angels. Through the lens of a sniper rifle, Bolan contemplates the perplexing choices of the young heir, while acknowledging the Thorndyke family\u2019s peculiar yet commendable nature. Recognizing that unraveling their enigmatic secrets can wait, the vigilant nightfighter withdraws his gaze from the scope, adroitly secures the rifle on his back, and descends the tree with finesse. Diligently disassembling the weapon and stowing it in his well-prepared duffel bag alongside his arsenal for the evening\u2019s mission, Bolan swiftly departs, determined to pursue his true objective: dismantling a vast drug smuggling operation orchestrated by renegade KGB remnants on a neighboring port."}], "temperature": 0.0, "response_format": {"type": "json_object"}}}

Abstract of Cited Paper (BIB001):  The stable levitation of small transparent glass spheres by the forces of radiation pressure has been demonstrated experimentally in air and vacuum down to pressures \u223c1 Torr. A single vertically directed focused TEM00\u2010mode cw laser beam of \u223c250 mW is sufficient to support stably a \u223c20\u2010\u03bc glass sphere. The restoring forces acting on a particle trapped in an optical potential well were probed optically by a second laser beam. At low pressures, effects arising from residual radiometric forces were seen. Possible applications are mentioned. \n2. Abstract of Cited Paper (BIB002):  Brownian motion of particles affects many branches of science. We report on the Brownian motion of micrometer-sized beads of glass held in air by an optical tweezer, over a wide range of pressures, and we measured the instantaneous velocity of a Brownian particle. Our results provide direct verification of the energy equipartition theorem for a Brownian particle. For short times, the ballistic regime of Brownian motion was observed, in contrast to the usual diffusive regime. We discuss the applications of these methods toward cooling the center-of-mass motion of a bead in vacuum to the quantum ground motional state. \n3. Abstract of Cited Paper (BIB003):  Measurement of the instantaneous velocity of Brownian motion of suspended particles in liquid probes the microscopic foundations of statistical mechanics in soft condensed matter. However, instantaneous velocity has eluded experimental observation for more than a century since Einstein's prediction of the small length and time scales involved. We report shot-noise-limited, high-bandwidth measurements of Brownian motion of micrometer-sized beads suspended in water and acetone by an optical tweezer. We observe the hydrodynamic instantaneous velocity of Brownian motion in a liquid, which follows a modified energy equipartition theorem that accounts for the kinetic energy of the fluid displaced by the moving bead. We also observe an anticorrelated thermal force, which is conventionally assumed to be uncorrelated.\n\nLiterature Review:"}], "temperature": 0.0, "response_format": {"type": "json_object"}}}

They recently acquired a small hotel chain headquartered in France. Brunt\u2019s chief executive decided that half of the new hotels in France would be retained and rebranded as part of the Brunt Hotels Group; the other half will be sold. This will support Brunt\u2019s strategic objective of growing the organization slowly to make sure that new ventures are well supported and opened on time and on budget. Brunt\u2019s hotels are considered budget accommodations; they are functional, clean and reasonably priced. \nMost guests stay for one to three nights and are a combination of business and leisure travellers. The hotels are typically situated in downtown locations that are easily accessible by mass transit. Tourists are attracted to these hotels in popular visitor destinations where the many local attractions mean that they will not be spending much time in their hotel rooms. The organization has decided to use an ethnocentric approach and send some of their existing UK-based managers to France to lead the changeover of the new hotels and then manage them after they re-open. If this new overseas venture is successful, Brunt may decide to acquire other small hotel groups in other European countries. The organization would like to own 150 hotels in the next fi ve years. Their 10-year plan is to own 300 hotels across Europe. This is an ambitious target, so it is important that the organization fi nds an effective formula to operate successfully in other countries.\n\n(Activity A) Based on the information from above, what do you think the key priorities should be? \n(Activity C) Write a recruitment advertisement for the new positions which can be sent to existing managers by e-mail. Your advertisement should include, at a minimum, the following information: \nMain responsibilities of the new job. \nThe skills you are looking for in the position. \n(Activity E) You are a management consultant who must design a selection process for the candidates. There is no budget limit for the development of the process; the senior management team knows that it is important to get the right person for the job. However, because the new hotels must be up and running quickly, they ask you to design a selection process which will take a maximum of two days. You must present your ideas and be able to justify why your method is appropriate. \n(Activity G) The management team asks you to conduct Internet-based research to find out what expatriate support services are available in France. You should create a list of the services that are available and provide details of at least one organization which could provide the services. These services should then be listed in order of priority for the expatriates. You will present your ideas, so you should be prepared to justify your reasons for prioritizing the services. \nDo you think Brunt Hotels should mostly hire expatriate or local managers? Why? \nWhich of the six managers listed below is most qualified to head the new division? Why? Which training should they attend to complete their skillset?\n\nOverview of Work History and Characteristics \nManager A: Now age 28, joined the organization at 18 years of age. Has worked for Brunt Hotels for 10 years. Five of these years were in a management position. Has never travelled abroad for business or holidays/vacations. Is concerned about not knowing very much about French culture and the way hotels are managed in France. \nManager B \u25a0 Age 55. \u25a0 Has worked for Brunt Hotels for 22 years. \u25a0 Joined the organization as a hotel cleaner and worked through the ranks to management. \u25a0 Regularly visits Asia for extended vacations but has never travelled in Europe. \u25a0 Is concerned that he or she is used to having a close support network in the UK and that this might not be possible due to the various locations of the French hotels. \nManager C \u25a0 Age 49. \u25a0 Has worked for Brunt Hotels for nine years. \u25a0 Joined the organization in a management role. \u25a0 Previously worked for a small, family-run hotel. \u25a0 Has visited France four times on family holidays. \u25a0 Is concerned that he or she has little HR knowledge and is worried about the implications when getting the new hotel ready. \nManager D \u25a0 Age 38. \u25a0 Joined Brunt Hotels six months ago. \u25a0 Is concerned that he or she has not had much management experience in this organization, but has previous management experience in another large hotel group. \u25a0 Is very interested in learning about new cultures. \u25a0 Has six years\u2019 previous experience of working in a restaurant. \u25a0 Is concerned that his or her family may fi nd it diffi cult to settle in France. \nManager E \u25a0 Age 21. \u25a0 Joined Brunt Hotels two years ago. \u25a0 Graduated from University three years ago. \u25a0 Completed a one-year placement in a French hotel as part of university degree. \u25a0 Understands some basic French and is keen to master the language. \u25a0 Is concerned about how his or her staff will react to having a young English manager. \nManager F \u25a0 Age 41. \u25a0 Joined Brunt Hotels 14 years ago. \u25a0 Became a manager for Brunt Hotels one year ago. \u25a0 Has six years\u2019 previous experience of working in a tourist information center. \u25a0 Is concerned about his or her communication skills and lack of IT skills.\n\nPlease cite any sources, APA Style."}], "temperature": 0.0, "response_format": {"type": "json_object"}}}

We\u2019ll treasure this slimy, sparkly art forever!\u201d\n\nScene 7: Departure to Dazzle Another Day\n\n- Gloopy and Glitter bid farewell to their new friend and her pink planet as they board their repaired blob-mobile.\n- They set off into the cosmos, eager for the next whimsical adventure, leaving behind a legacy of laughter and slime-art on Rosalux.\n\nVoiceover: \u201cAnd so, Gloopy and Glitter continue their journey across the stars, spreading creativity and joy in the slimiest of ways!\u201d\n\n- As the blob-mobile zooms away, the camera pans to show the glowing pink planet, now adorned with slime sculptures shimmering under the starlight.\nWrite character descriptions about the 2, their appearance, personality and abilitieas\nCharacter: Gloopy\n\nAppearance:\n- Gloopy is a laid-back teal blob with a semi-translucent body that exudes a gentle glow.\n- His eyes are two small floating orbs within his gelatinous form, exuding warmth and friendliness with every blink.\n- A charming smile is often etched near what would conventionally be the front of his blobby body.\n- Whenever Gloopy moves, his body wobbles and reshapes, showing his flexible and adaptable nature visually.\n\nPersonality:\n- The essence of chill, Gloopy is the kind of blob that takes life at a relaxed pace, believing in going with the flow.\n- He\u2019s got a sunny disposition, is never in a hurry, and loves to soak up the cosmic tunes with his entire being.\n- A great listener, Gloopy is supportive and often serves as the voice of reason in his adventures with Glitter.\n- His open-mindedness and creativity make him a hit in the artsy circles of the galaxy and an endearing figure to friends.\n\nAbilities:\n- Gloopy\u2019s malleable form allows him to stretch, squish, and reshape himself into a variety of configurations, from thin pancake-like extensions to bouncy spheres.\n- He can absorb certain impacts like a jelly, which also helps him get out of sticky situations, both figuratively and literally.\n- Gloopy has a unique talent for creating and controlling sound waves with his slimy vibrations, using them to communicate or to soothe friends with his space-themed tunes.\n\nCharacter: Glitter\n\nAppearance:\n- Glitter is a sparkling fuchsia blob with a brighter and more solid appearance than Gloopy, emitting a constant stream of fine glitter that leaves trails wherever she goes.\n- Like Gloopy, her eyes are floating sparkly specks that always seem to be twinkling with excitement.\n- Her smile gleams brightly, often punctuated by bursts of shimmer when she\u2019s particularly joyful or enthusiastic.\n\nPersonality:\n- Full of vim and vigor, Glitter is the dynamo of the duo, always eager to embark on new adventures and concoct new experiments in their bubbling lab.\n- A fountain of ideas and initiatives, she\u2019s the driving force behind their escapades, often sparking action with her sparkly personality.\n- Resourceful and inventive, Glitter often combines her love for all things shiny with practical solutions, though her enthusiasm can occasionally lead to dazzlingly unpredictable consequences.\n\nAbilities:\n- Glitter\u2019s body is infused with a mysterious sparkle dust, which she can control and manipulate to create awe-inspiring light shows or to enhance their visibility in various performances.\n- She has a unique ability to concoct various potions and serums, many of which have glittery effects that can be both beneficial and mesmerizing.\n- Her sparkles have a subtle, magical quality, capable of cleaning, repairing, or creating things, making her a handy blob to have around in a crisis or for a touch of pizzazz.\n\nTogether, Gloopy and Glitter are an unstoppable team, complementing each other\u2019s abilities and personalities as they embark on intergalactic adventures, spreading good vibes and glitter dust across the cosmos.\n\nTitle: \u201cThe Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter\u201d\n\nEpisode: \u201cThe Barren Planet of Shadows\u201d\n\nScene 1: Lost in the Cosmos\n\n- The blob-mobile zips across the cosmos, its warp drive allowing Gloopy and Glitter to push the boundaries of their explorations like never before.\n- Suddenly, the warp drive sputters, and alarms blare. They\u2019re pulled into the gravitational field of an uncharted planet.\n\nGloopy: \u201cWhoa, the warp drive is acting up. We\u2019re going in for an unexpected landing, Glitter!\u201d\n\nGlitter: \u201cHang on, Gloopy! Let\u2019s make this an opportunity to discover something new!\u201d\n\n- The blob-mobile makes a bouncy touchdown onto the surface of a dusty, gray planet devoid of color and light.\n\nScene 2: The Mysterious Terrain\n\n- Stepping out of their ship, Gloopy and Glitter look around at the stark landscape. Mountains loom in the distance, and the ground is littered with jagged rocks.\n- The planet is in perpetual twilight, with a dim star casting long, creeping shadows.\n\nGloopy: \u201cThis place could use some of our sparkly charm, don\u2019t you think?\u201d\n\nGlitter: \u201cDefinitely. It\u2019s so\u2026 drab.\u201d\n\nScene 3: The Shadow Stir\n\n- As they traverse the dull terrain, seeking materials to repair the blob-mobile, Gloopy\u2019s gooey footprints and Glitter\u2019s sparkly trail are the only sources of brightness in this gloomy world.\n- Unexpectedly, the shadows cast by the dim star begin to move and swirl around their bright paths. It\u2019s as if the shadows are alive, curious, and drawn to their light.\n\nGlitter (puzzlement shimmering in her eyes): \u201cDo you see that, Gloopy? The shadows are moving!\u201d\n\nGloopy: \u201cThey seem to like our glow. Hey there, shadows, we come in peace and sparkles!\u201d\n\nScene 4: The Connection\n\n- As they continue, Gloopy and Glitter start to play with the shadows, creating shapes with their bodies and watching the shadows mimic them.\n- This interaction seems to delight the shadows, who begin to form patterns and symbols on the ground, signaling some form of communication.\n\nGlitter (excitedly): \u201cGloopy, they\u2019re smart! Let\u2019s see if we can understand them.\u201d\n\nScene 5: Learning and Teaching\n\n- Gloopy and Glitter try different movements and gestures while observing the shadows\u2019 responses.\n- After some time, a rudimentary form of dialogue emerges\u2014through the language of light and shadow, they begin to understand one another.\n\nGloopy (nodding thoughtfully): \u201cThey\u2019re telling us they haven\u2019t seen light like ours in ages. They\u2019ve missed it.\u201d\n\nGlitter: \u201cAnd they\u2019re saying they want to help us fix the ship! How incredible!\u201d\n\nScene 6: Cooperation\n\n- With guidance from the shadows, Gloopy and Glitter locate the necessary materials scattered around the barren planet.\n- The shadows playfully assist, enveloping objects in darkness to highlight them against the gray backdrop.\n\nGloopy: \u201cThanks, friends! This sure is teamwork of a whole new shade!\u201d\n\nGlitter: \u201cYour turn to shine, my little shadows!\u201d\n\nScene 7: The Transformation\n\n- As the blob-mobile is being repaired, Glitter gets a bright idea. She gathers her potions and concocts a special mixture of her glitter and Gloopy\u2019s goo.\n- Spreading the mixture onto the landscape, a remarkable transformation occurs. The dull terrain begins to sparkle, and the shadows start to dance with color.\n\nGlitter (with a heart full of glee): \u201cA little bit of Gloopy, a little bit of Glitter, and voil\u00e0!\u201d\n\nScene 8: A World Reborn\n\n- The lifeless planet comes to life, bursting with colors as the shadows reflect the newfound light from every shimmering rock and sparkling crevice.\n- The shadows, now intertwined with the light, create an ethereal glow that stretches as far as the eye can see.\n\nGloopy (in awe): \u201cWe didn\u2019t just find a new world\u2014we helped create one.\u201d\n\nGlitter: \u201cAnd we\u2019ve made new friends who taught us the beauty that lies in the shadows.\u201d\n\nScene 9: Farewell and Forward\n\n- With the blob-mobile repaired and the memories of a once barren planet now teeming with prismatic hues, Gloopy and Glitter bid their new friends goodbye.\n- The shadows wave in their own fluid, graceful way as the duo blasts off, leaving behind a legacy of light in the darkness.\n\nVoiceover: \u201cAnd with their hearts a little fuller, Gloopy and Glitter continue their odyssey amongst the stars, forever seeking to brighten the cosmos, one rejuvenated world at a time.\u201d\n\n- The screen fades to black, with the echoes of Gloopy and Glitter\u2019s laughter trailing off, the barren planet they left now aglow with vibrant shadows and radiant sparkles.\n\nTitle: \u201cGloopy\u2019s Shape Sensation\u201d\n\nScene 1: An Unexpected Audience\n\n- Our adventure begins with Gloopy and Glitter exploring the vast cosmos, powered by the warp drive they won from \u201cThe Great Space Entry\u201d competition. Their blob-mobile navigates through the starry expanse, zipping past comets and asteroid belts.\n\nGlitter: \u201cGloopy, I\u2019ve pinpointed an unexplored planet on the map. It\u2019s known as Forma-5, famous for its inhabitants\u2019 love for art and performance!\u201d\n\nGloopy: \u201cSounds like a place where I can stretch my\u2026 talents! Let\u2019s check it out!\u201d\n\n- They land on Forma-5 and are greeted by its geometrically shaped inhabitants, beings who can change colors but not their forms.\n\nScene 2: Discovering Gloopy\u2019s Talent\n\n- Gloopy and Glitter visit the central plaza, where locals are showcasing their art. Though their color transformations are beautiful, Gloopy quietly starts to play around, innocently morphing into various shapes\u2014circles, stars, and even mimicking some of the local architecture.\n\nChild-Like Hexagon: \u201cLook, mom! That stranger can change his shape!\u201d\n\n- Soon, a small crowd gathers, marveling at Gloopy\u2019s effortless transformations. Word quickly spreads about the incredible shapeshifting visitor.\n\nScene 3: The Invitation\n\n- The mayor of Forma-5, a dignified dodecahedron named Dodecy, approaches Gloopy and Glitter with an offer.\n\nMayor Dodecy: \u201cGloopy, your ability is a gift! We\u2019ve never seen such talent. Would you honor us by performing at our Grand Plaza tonight? Your art could inspire our youth and bring joy to our citizens!\u201d\n\nGlitter, beaming with pride: \u201cWhat do you say, Gloopy?\u201d\n\nGloopy: \u201cI\u2019d be thrilled! Let\u2019s make it a night to remember!\u201d\n\nScene 4: Preparing the Performance\n\n- Backstage, Glitter helps Gloopy prepare. She applies a bit of her glitter to make his transformations sparkle in the night.\n\nGlitter: \u201cWith each shape you make, let\u2019s add a burst of sparkle to illuminate your art even further!\u201d\n\nGloopy: \u201cThis is going to be spectacular. I can\u2019t wait to share our sparkle with everyone.\u201d\n\nScene 5: The Grand Performance\n\n- As night falls, Gloopy takes center stage under the stars. The plaza is filled with thousands of Forma-5\u2019s inhabitants, eagerly waiting in anticipation.\n\nAnnouncer: \u201cPresenting Gloopy, the Shapeshifting Sensation from the faraway world of Gloopiter!\u201d\n\n- With each beat of the cosmic melody, Gloopy transforms. He becomes a star, a bird, an intricate flower blooming\u2014all sparkling under Glitter\u2019s magical touch. His performance tells a story of friendship, adventure, and the beauty of being unique.\n\nScene 6: A Standing Ovation\n\n- The crowd is mesmerized. As Gloopy finishes with a grand finale\u2014morphing into a replica of Forma-5 itself, surrounded by miniatures of its inhabitants\u2014the audience erupts into a standing ovation. Gloopy\u2019s shapes, combined with Glitter\u2019s effervescence, have created a dazzling spectacle of light and movement.\n\nMayor Dodecy: \u201cGloopy, your performance was more than art. It was a celebration of what makes each of us unique.\u201d\n\nScene 7: Inspiring a Planet\n\n- Inspired by Gloopy, the inhabitants of Forma-5 start experimenting with their own forms of artistic expression beyond color changes. They begin to create sculptures and paintings, trying to capture the essence of Gloopy\u2019s shapeshifting within their static forms.\n\nScene 8: A Heartwarming Farewell\n\n- As Gloopy and Glitter prepare to leave, they\u2019re showered with gifts and heartfelt goodbyes. Children mimic Gloopy\u2019s shapes; artists share their Gloopy-inspired art.\n\nGloopy, touched: \u201cI never knew my shapeshifting could bring so much happiness. What an unforgettable experience!\u201d\n\nGlitter: \u201cYou\u2019ve touched their hearts, Gloopy. Let\u2019s keep spreading joy across the stars.\u201d\n\n- They board their blob-mobile, leaving behind a planet now bursting with new forms of expression, a testament to the power of sharing one\u2019s talents.\n\nVoiceover: \u201cWith Forma-5 in their wake, Gloopy and Glitter continue their cosmic journey, leaving a trail of inspiration and creativity. Wherever they go, they remind us that it\u2019s our unique qualities that truly make us shine.\u201d\n\n- The stars twinkle a little brighter as the screen fades to black, the shared laughter of Gloopy and Glitter echoing into the vastness of space.\n\nTitle: \"The Mysterious Infinite Mall\"\n\nScene 1: Glitter\u2019s Mysterious Encounter\n\n- Gloopy and Glitter had decided to take a break from their intergalactic adventures and explore a bustling space mall for a change of scenery. As Gloopy headed to the bathroom, Glitter, with her sparkly trail in tow, ventured off on her own.\n\n- Lost in the maze-like corridors of the mall, Glitter marveled at the variety of shops and alien species bustling about. Suddenly, she stumbled upon a peculiar sight \u2013 a tentacled alien with shimmering purple scales muttering to itself.\n\nAlien: \u201cInfinite, forever, never ending. This mall is a maze that traps all who enter. Beware, little glow.\u201d\n\n- Intrigued by the cryptic words, Glitter approached the tentacled alien cautiously.\n\nGlitter: \u201cExcuse me, kind alien. What do you mean this mall is \u2018infinite, forever, never ending\u2019?\u201d\n\nAlien (with a hiss): \u201cAh, little glow, those who wander too far may never find their way out. The walls shift, the paths change. Many have been lost within these halls.\u201d\n\n- Filled with concern for Gloopy and herself, Glitter knew she had to find a way out of this strange and foreboding mall maze.\n\nScene 2: Gloopy\u2019s Discovery\n\n- Meanwhile, Gloopy finished up in the bathroom and went in search of Glitter. However, with the twisting and turning corridors of the mall, he found himself disoriented and unsure of which way to go.\n\n- As he meandered through the maze of shops, Gloopy stumbled upon a group of lost alien children, huddled together in confusion.\n\nAlien Child: \u201cHelp us, friendly blob! We can\u2019t find our parents, and this mall seems to go on forever.\u201d\n\nGloopy: \u201cDon\u2019t worry, little ones. Gloopy is here to help. Let\u2019s stick together and find a way out.\u201d\n\nScene 3: A Uniting Force\n\n- Gloopy and the lost alien children set out to navigate the labyrinthine mall together, using Gloopy\u2019s malleable form and the children\u2019s keen eyes to spot familiar landmarks.\n\n- Meanwhile, Glitter and the tentacled alien worked together to decipher the shifting patterns of the mall maze, using Glitter\u2019s sparkling trail as a guiding light.\n\n- Despite the challenges and the ever-changing layout of the mall, the two groups slowly made progress towards each other, driven by a shared determination to reunite.\n\nScene 4: A Glittering Resolution\n\n- Finally, after what seemed like hours of wandering, Gloopy and Glitter caught sight of each other in the distance, their joyful reunion a beacon of hope amidst the confusing corridors of the mall.\n\n- With a few clever twists and turns, Gloopy and Glitter managed to lead the lost children back to their relieved parents, reuniting families and bringing a sense of peace to the mall maze.\n\n- As they prepared to leave the mall, the tentacled alien approached Gloopy and Glitter, a gleam in its eyes.\n\nAlien: \u201cYou have shown kindness and bravery in the face of uncertainty, little glow and friendly blob. May your light shine bright in all your adventures.\u201d\n\n- With gratitude in their hearts and a newfound appreciation for the power of teamwork, Gloopy and Glitter bid farewell to the mysterious mall maze, ready to continue their journey through the endless wonders of the cosmos.\n\nTHE END\nWrite a forum conversation in late October 2023 where as of mid November, it is replaced on Kids WB by the Amazing Adrenalini Brothers, the latter hasn\u2019t aired since March, Compiled with the fact that the only other shows airing new episodes are Code Lyoko, Ultimate Spider-Man, Teen Titans Go and Scooby-Doo Mystery Incorporated, people think the show will eventually have to come back, maybe in one of the slots currently occupied by Johnny Test or Xiaolin Showdown\nForum Thread Title: \u201cIs \u2018The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter\u2019 Coming Back to Kids WB?\u201d\n\nUser1: CosmicFan88\nPosted on October 24, 2023, at 10:33 AM\n\nHey everyone! Just heard that \u2018The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter\u2019 is being replaced by \u2018The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers\u2019 in mid-November. I\u2019m a bit bummed since Gloopy and Glitter have been a refreshing addition to the lineup. Any chance it will make a comeback? Thoughts?\n\nUser2: SparkleQueen101\nPosted on October 24, 2023, at 11:15 AM\n\nI\u2019m surprised too @CosmicFan88! \u2018Gloopy and Glitter\u2019 was doing well with ratings, right? \ud83e\udd14 Maybe Kids WB is just shuffling things around for a bit\u2026 I hope it\u2019s not gone for good.\n\nUser3: ToonTracker67\nPosted on October 24, 2023, at 11:45 AM\n\nNot to worry, @SparkleQueen101 and @CosmicFan88. The network often rotates shows for variety. Given that only a handful of series like \u2018Code Lyoko\u2019, \u2018Ultimate Spider-Man\u2019, \u2018Teen Titans Go\u2019, and \u2018Scooby-Doo Mystery Inc.\u2019 are airing new eps, \u2018Gloopy & Glitter\u2019 might return once there\u2019s space in the schedule.\n\nUser4: SpaceJelly\nPosted on October 24, 2023, at 12:30 PM\n\nI heard a rumor that \u2018Johnny Test\u2019 might be in its last season. If that\u2019s true, \u2018Gloopy and Glitter\u2019 could take that slot. Fingers crossed! \ud83e\udd1e\n\nUser5: XiaolinDragon\nPosted on October 24, 2023, at 01:50 PM\n\nUser4: SpaceJelly, that would make sense. \u2018Johnny Test\u2019 has had a long run. Plus, \u2018Xiaolin Showdown\u2019 is also nearing its end, so there\u2019s another potential slot right there for \u2018Gloopy and Glitter\u2019. Let\u2019s stay optimistic!\n\nUser6: WebHead93\nPosted on October 24, 2023, at 02:15 PM\n\nHonestly, I\u2019d be okay if \u2018Ultimate Spider-Man\u2019 took a short break too. It\u2019s been on for a while, and a hiatus could make room for \u2018Gloopy and Glitter\u2019. Just sayin\u2019.\n\nModerator: ToonTalker\nPosted on October 24, 2023, at 02:45 PM\n\nReminder to all users: Let\u2019s keep the conversation friendly and on-topic. Speculation is natural, but let\u2019s not petition for other shows to go off-air. Kids WB hasn\u2019t made any official statements regarding \u2018Gloopy and Glitter\u2019s\u2019 return, but I\u2019ll make sure to update the forum if news comes in.\n\nUser7: GloopTroop\nPosted on October 24, 2023, at 03:30 PM\n\n\u2018Gloopy and Glitter\u2019 brought something unique to the mix. I\u2019m hoping it\u2019s just a seasonal thing. Maybe they\u2019re planning a holiday special? That\u2019d be awesome to see in December.\n\nUser8: StarlightShimmer\nPosted on October 24, 2023, at 04:10 PM\n\nI\u2019ve seen cases where shows go on hiatus and then come back with a bang. In this case, \u2018Gloopy and Glitter\u2019 could use the break to ensure its return is spectacular. Patience is key, folks!\n\nUser9: TheAnimatedFan\nPosted on October 24, 2023, at 04:45 PM\n\nThis isn\u2019t the first time \u2018The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers\u2019 popped back in after a hiatus. I\u2019m confident that \u2018Gloopy and Glitter\u2019 will be back. Kids WB seems to like to surprise us with comebacks. Stay tooned!\n\nUser1: CosmicFan88\nPosted on October 24, 2023, at 05:33 PM\n\nAppreciate the insight, everyone! Here\u2019s hoping our favorite blobs make a grand return. 'Til then, I guess I\u2019ll catch up on other shows. Let\u2019s keep an eye out for any updates. Keep it cosmic! \u2728\n\nModerator: ToonTalker\nPosted on October 25, 2023, at 09:00 AM\n\nJust a heads-up to all users, Kids WB will be airing marathons of \u2018Gloopy and Glitter\u2019 next weekend, which could be a good sign!

User1: Hey everyone! Did you all catch the launch of CW4Kids on the CW today? It was supposed to be this huge rebranding from Kids\u2019 WB, but it all looked pretty much the same to me, just with a different logo. They even had the same schedule and promos.\n\nUser2: Yeah, I tuned in this morning expecting something totally different, but it was almost like nothing changed. My little brother didn\u2019t even notice the switch to CW4Kids until I pointed out the new logo to him.\n\nUser3: I read that the real changes are coming in April, with a complete overhaul of the programming block. But starting January 20th, we\u2019re beginning to see some of the 4Kids content making its debut. Seems like they\u2019re starting slow and then hitting us with the big changes later.\n\nAnimatedFan4Life: Kind of sad to see Kids\u2019 WB go, but looking forward to seeing what 4Kids does with the block. \u201cPokemon Indigo League\u201d and \u201cSonic X\u201d are being added to the schedule later this month, and I can\u2019t wait for those!\n\nToonWatcher: Have you all seen the future programming list? \u201cChaotic\u201d and \u201cTMNT: Back to the Sewers\u201d sound interesting. I miss the old 4Kids block, so it\u2019s kind of nostalgic to see them take over CW.\n\nUser1: Yeah, I noticed \u201cSquish\u201d and \u201cThe Amazing Adrenalini Brothers\u201d got the axe for the new additions. I\u2019m curious how the CW4Kids identity is going to evolve. Will it keep some of that old WB flavor, or are we looking at a total 4Kids takeover?\n\n90sCartoonKid: I think CW4Kids should keep some of the legacy content while bringing in fresh shows. Kids\u2019 WB had some great shows that shouldn\u2019t be forgotten. Here\u2019s hoping the overhaul in April will give us the best of both worlds.\n\nMangaManiac: Just waiting for \u201cYu-Gi-Oh 5Ds\u201d to hit the CW4Kids lineup. They teased future programming, and that\u2019s what I\u2019m most excited about. 4Kids always did well with Yu-Gi-Oh series.\n\nDigiDestined: Kinda mixed feelings about the rebranding. Kids\u2019 WB was iconic, but 4Kids had some solid shows too. The transition period seems like a smart move to not alienate the current viewers. Just hope the overhaul keeps the quality up.\n\nSaturdayMorningFan: Noticed the bumpers still had that Kids\u2019 WB vibe with just a logo swap. I\u2019m intrigued by how they will rebrand the whole aesthetic come April. This gradual shift could be a good way to ease the audience into the changes.\n\nUser4: Does anyone know if the timeslots will change drastically? You know, with certain 4Kids shows having particular requirements and all that?\n\nTVTimeTraveller: No significant timeslot changes announced yet aside from the two show swaps on Jan 20th. We might see a shuffle in April, but hopefully, they\u2019ll keep the fan-favorites in prime positions.\n\nUser5: Honestly, as long as they keep airing \u201cBatman: The Brave and the Bold\u201d and \u201cTeen Titans Go!\u201d, my Saturdays are set. Though I am curious to see what new shows 4Kids will bring to the mix, just hope they don\u2019t mess with a good thing!\n\nUser2: Ditto, I\u2019m all for new content as long as quality doesn\u2019t drop. But hey, it\u2019s 4Kids, they know what they\u2019re doing. Let\u2019s give 'em a chance!\n\nUser 1 (Club Toon Moderator):\nHey fellow cartoon fans! Have you checked out the latest schedule change for CW4Kids? Starting January 20, 2024, they\u2019ve shaken things up a bit. I\u2019m digging the addition of \u201cPokemon Indigo League\u201d to the morning lineup. Feels like a throwback to the old days, doesn\u2019t it?\n\nUser 2 (Anime_Avenger):\nAbsolutely, User 1! I\u2019m thrilled to see \u201cPokemon Indigo League\u201d on the schedule. It\u2019s classic! But I\u2019m a bit concerned about \u201cCode Lyoko\u201d and \u201cScooby Doo: Mystery Incorporated\u201d \u2013 rumor has it they might not stick around much longer with 4Kids taking over.\n\nUser 3 (SaturdayMorningNostalgia):\nAnd speaking of throwbacks, my local CW station\u2019s started airing Toonattik on Saturdays, so CW4Kids has been moved to Sundays now. Not sure how I feel about it, but as long as they keep bringing solid shows, I\u2019m good.\n\nUser 4 (TheCartoonCritic):\nI\u2019ve been enjoying the \u201cKids\u2019 WB style\u201d branding, it has a nostalgic vibe. But according to some whispers around the web, they\u2019re looking to overhaul that by April. I\u2019m curious to see what the new aesthetic will be once 4Kids fully transitions in.\n\nUser 5 (ToonSquadMember):\nI\u2019m kind of split, guys. It\u2019s cool 4Kids is keeping some Kids\u2019 WB content around for transition, but I\u2019m not looking forward to saying goodbye to \u201cCode Lyoko\u201d and \u201cScooby Doo: MI.\u201d They\u2019re a staple for my weekend cartoon binge.\n\nUser 2 (Anime_Avenger):\n@ToonSquadMember, I feel you. But hey, we\u2019re also getting some new shows in the future, like \u201cPokemon Horizons: The Series\u201d and \u201cYu-Gi-Oh 5Ds.\u201d Change can be good, right?\n\nUser 6 (RetroTooner):\nNew shows are great, but I\u2019m a bit dubious about \u201cGoGoRiki\u201d and \u201cViva Pinata.\u201d Not exactly the hard hitters like some of the current or former programming. Hope they hold up. BTW, has anyone got intel on if \u201cTeen Titans Go!\u201d will continue to be part of the new look?\n\nUser 4 (TheCartoonCritic):\n@RetroTooner From what I hear, \u201cTeen Titans Go!\u201d is performing well with the audience, so I think it\u2019s safe for now. But you know how it goes with network decisions.\n\nUser 7 (DigitalPokeFan003):\nFingers crossed they keep the right mix of the old and the new. A nod to their history with Kids\u2019 WB but still keeping it fresh for the new generation. It\u2019s all about that balance!\n\nUser 1 (Club Toon Moderator):\nWell said, DigitalPokeFan003. Let\u2019s keep the conversation going and be sure to update each other with any new developments regarding the CW4Kids schedule or news. Until then, let\u2019s enjoy the nostalgia trip with the current lineup!\nWrite a follow up where XS, TTG, BTBATB and JT will stay until late March\nUser 1 (Club Toon Moderator):\nHey everyone! Got some exciting updates about our beloved CW4Kids schedule! Looks like \u201cXiaolin Showdown,\u201d \u201cTeen Titans Go!,\u201d \u201cBatman: The Brave and the Bold,\u201d and \u201cJohnny Test\u201d will be with us until at least late March. Seems like they want to give us a proper send-off for these classics.\n\nUser 3 (SaturdayMorningNostalgia):\nOh, that\u2019s fantastic news! Especially happy about \u201cXiaolin Showdown\u201d sticking around \u2013 that show has some of the most creative showdowns ever animated. And \u201cBatman: The Brave and the Bold\u201d has that perfect mix of action and humor.\n\nUser 5 (ToonSquadMember):\nRelieved to hear \u201cTeen Titans Go!\u201d is staying put for a bit longer. It\u2019s like the ultimate comfort food of cartoons \u2013 always gives me a good laugh.\n\nUser 2 (Anime_Avenger):\nAgreed! And while \u201cJohnny Test\u201d may not be everyone\u2019s cup of tea, it\u2019s kind of grown on me over the years. It\u2019ll be somewhat bittersweet to see these titles go, but I\u2019m also looking forward to what the new lineup will be like!\n\nUser 4 (TheCartoonCritic):\nLate March, huh? Gives us a bit more time to prepare for the transition. I\u2019m really curious how they will wrap things up with these shows. Hope they do it in a way that honors their legacy on the block.\n\nUser 8 (ComicBookJones):\nI gotta say, this schedule has been a staple of my weekend chill time. \u201cBatman: The Brave and the Bold\u201d is my personal favorite\u2014nothing beats classic Batman teamed up with other heroes from the DC universe. But hey, I\u2019m always game for new adventures. Change is the spice of life, right?\n\nUser 6 (RetroTooner):\nMost definitely! Change keeps things fresh. But before we say goodbye to these shows, we should definitely enjoy them while they last. And maybe even have a marathon before the big switch!\n\nUser 7 (DigitalPokeFan003):\nA marathon sounds like a plan! I\u2019m in. And let\u2019s keep each other posted on when new shows get announced. The wait for \u201cPokemon Horizons: The Series\u201d is killing me, though!\n\nUser 1 (Club Toon Moderator):\nLove the positive vibes and enthusiasm, folks! We\u2019ll definitely plan out that marathon. In the meantime, let\u2019s continue to support our favorite shows till the very end. Late March will come sooner than we think, so let\u2019s savor the moments. Keep tuning in, and keep this forum alive with updates!\nWrite a follow up where Kirby replaces The Hollow NEXT WEEK, also Code Lyoko runs out of new episodes next week, and will be going into rerun mode until it\u2019s removal in early March, Scooby is leaving as soon as it runs out, being replaced with Ultimate Muscle\nUser 1 (Club Toon Moderator):\nBreaking news for you CW4Kids fans! Next week brings a couple of big changes to our Sunday lineup. \u201cThe Hollow\u201d is taking a bow and making room for \u201cKirby: Right Back At Ya!\u201d to swoop in. Also, looks like we\u2019ve reached the end of the line for new \u201cCode Lyoko\u201d episodes; they\u2019ll be starting reruns next week until its scheduled removal in early March.\n\nUser 9 (KirbyStarWarrior):\nYes! \u201cKirby: Right Back At Ya!\u201d is coming back? That\u2019s awesome! Kirby\u2019s adventures never get old. I\u2019m here for those monster battles and Dedede\u2019s shenanigans.\n\nUser 2 (Anime_Avenger):\nMeanwhile, feeling a little melancholic about \u201cCode Lyoko.\u201d It\u2019s been one of the best sci-fi toons out there. Hope they give it a solid rerun send-off. And what about \u201cScooby-Doo: Mystery Incorporated\u201d?\n\nUser 1 (Club Toon Moderator):\n@Anime_Avenger, \u201cSDMI\u201d is reportedly on the way out too. Word is it\u2019ll be replaced by \u201cUltimate Muscle\u201d as soon as it runs out of episodes. Guess we\u2019re heading toward a more action-packed slate?\n\nUser 6 (RetroTooner):\n\u201cUltimate Muscle,\u201d huh? That\u2019s a blast from the wrestling ring past! I did enjoy the mix of humor and action in that show. Hopefully, it\u2019ll bring some good energy to the block.\n\nUser 4 (TheCartoonCritic):\nWhile it\u2019s sad to see \u201cCode Lyoko\u201d and \u201cScooby-Doo: Mystery Incorporated\u201d phase out, \u201cKirby\u201d and \u201cUltimate Muscle\u201d might just fill that void. They both have that unique blend of action and humor that can really capture that CW4Kids spirit.\n\nUser 7 (DigitalPokeFan003):\nI\u2019m curious about this shift towards action-oriented programming. I\u2019ll miss the mystery vibe from \u201cScooby-Doo,\u201d but I remember \u201cUltimate Muscle\u201d being quite the ride. Definitely gonna give \u201cKirby\u201d a shot too!\n\nUser 5 (ToonSquadMember):\nIt\u2019s always hard to say goodbye to beloved shows, but CW4Kids has always been about mixing things up. Let\u2019s keep supporting the block. Who knows? Maybe these changes will introduce us to some new favorites!\n\nUser 3 (SaturdayMorningNostalgia):\nChanges or not, Sunday morning cartoons are a ritual! \u201cKirby\u201d and \u201cUltimate Muscle\u201d will make for a fun combo. Let\u2019s give these new shows a warm welcome while we take that last lap with \u201cCode Lyoko.\u201d It\u2019ll be a bittersweet March for sure.\n\nUser 1 (Club Toon Moderator):\nCouldn\u2019t have said it better myself. It\u2019s all about ushering in the new era while bidding a proper farewell to the old. Let\u2019s enjoy them all for now, and as always, keep each other in the loop with any new info! Happy viewing, everyone!\nWrite a follow up where since one of the upcoming shows is very light hearted, it is assumed it will replace both Titans and Johnny\nUser 1 (Club Toon Moderator):\nTime for another update on the ever-evolving CW4Kids scene! With the departure of some of our beloved shows and a few new reveals about the upcoming programming, there are strong indications that one particularly light-hearted show is getting primed to take the slots of both \u201cTeen Titans Go!\u201d and \u201cJohnny Test.\u201d\n\nUser 10 (CartoonConnoisseur):\nWhaaat? Both \u201cTeen Titans Go!\u201d and \u201cJohnny Test\u201d might get swapped out for just one show? As much as I enjoy a fun, light-hearted series, that\u2019s a lot of zany energy to replace. I wonder what show can handle that task.\n\nUser 7 (DigitalPokeFan003):\nI bet it\u2019s going to be \u201cGoGoRiki.\u201d That\u2019s the one I\u2019ve heard is all about that fun vibe with a splash of learning. It\u2019s quite the shift from our usual Saturday/Sunday morning slapstick, but change keeps things interesting, right?\n\nUser 4 (TheCartoonCritic):\nI\u2019ll miss the antics of \u201cTeen Titans Go!\u201d for sure, but maybe \u201cGoGoRiki\u201d will have that same kind of quirky appeal? We could use a fresh flavor after so much time, and a move towards a lighter-hearted program could be just the thing.\n\nUser 2 (Anime_Avenger):\nReplacing both at once seems like a big gamble, especially given how solid \u201cTeen Titans Go!\u201d and \u201cJohnny Test\u201d are as standalones. But hey, I guess we\u2019ve gotta trust that CW4Kids knows what they\u2019re doing. Still, I\u2019ll hold a little vigil for our departing shows.\n\nUser 3 (SaturdayMorningNostalgia):\nNo more \u201cJohnny Test\u201d whirlwinds and \u201cTeen Titans\u201d craziness? That\u2019s a chunk of my Sunday routine about to change. But these shake-ups usually bring in something fresh, so I\u2019m keeping an open mind about \u201cGoGoRiki.\u201d\n\nUser 5 (ToonSquadMember):\nI\u2019m up for new shows but I really hope the replacement has the charm and wit of \u201cTitans\u201d and \u201cJohnny.\u201d Otherwise, it might feel like too much of a void. Change is good\u2026when it\u2019s the right change.\n\nUser 8 (ComicBookJones):\n\u201cTeen Titans Go!\u201d and \u201cJohnny Test\u201d dropping in one go seems like the end of an era. Fingers crossed \u201cGoGoRiki\u201d can fill those shoes with its own style. I\u2019m always ready for more toon goodness, so bring it on!\n\nUser 1 (Club Toon Moderator):\nYou\u2019ve all got the spirit! As we anticipate \u201cGoGoRiki\u201d (or whatever the new show might be), let\u2019s not forget there are still a few weeks to savor \u201cTeen Titans Go!\u201d and \u201cJohnny Test.\u201d Let\u2019s enjoy the last moments with our favorites and stay tuned for what\u2019s next\u2014this is the story of Saturday/Sunday morning TV, always in motion. Keep chatting and sharing what you hear, folks!\n\nUser 1 (Club Toon Moderator):\nHeads up, toon troops! Have you all had a chance to check out the new CW4Kids website? It feels like a blast from the past\u2014right now, it\u2019s got that basic Weebly vibe going on. And get this, even though we\u2019ve been watching \u201cPokemon\u201d and \u201cSonic X\u201d for a while, it looks like they\u2019ve only just got their show pages up and running.\n\nUser 11 (WebWizard):\nOh definitely, the CW4Kids website is pretty nostalgic with its simplicity. Kinda surprised \u201cSquish\u201d and \u201cThe Amazing Adrenalini Brothers\u201d still have their old pages there, though. Talk about remnants of the Kids\u2019 WB era!\n\nUser 12 (4KidsMod):\nHey User 11, glad you\u2019ve noticed\u2014and sorry about the confusion! The transition from kidswb.com is a work in progress. Over the next few months, you guys will see the CW4Kids site evolve to reflect our full rebrand, much like the classic 4Kids.tv! Expect a full redirect by early April, and tons of cool updates along the way.\n\nUser 5 (ToonSquadMember):\nYay for updates! The current site is a bit of a time warp, lol. Can\u2019t wait to see the full 4Kids makeover. Here\u2019s hoping they\u2019ll keep some of the interactivity and games we used to love on 4Kids.tv.\n\nUser 2 (Anime_Avenger):\n@4KidsMod, thanks for the heads up! Really hoping for those interactive elements. Will the new site have streaming options for episodes too? That\u2019d be a sweet addition.\n\nUser 12 (4KidsMod):\nStreaming is definitely on our radar, Anime_Avenger. Can\u2019t spill all the beans yet, but we\u2019re aiming to create a space that\u2019s not just informational but also interactive and entertaining. Stay tuned!\n\nUser 7 (DigitalPokeFan003):\nAwesome to hear! I\u2019ve got some fond memories browsing 4Kids.tv back in the day. The CW4Kids website holding onto old show pages is kind of like keeping a piece of history alive. Super curious to see them transition to the new lineup though.\n\nUser 8 (ComicBookJones):\nWho knew a website could be so nostalgic? I guess it\u2019s part of the growing pains. Here\u2019s hoping for a smooth transition. And thanks, @4KidsMod, for keeping us in the loop!\n\nUser 1 (Club Toon Moderator):\nSounds like the digital side of CW4Kids is going to catch up with the broadcasting side soon. Until then, let\u2019s make the most of the retro look and feel of the site. And let\u2019s hope they keep that corner for fan art and forums\u2014gotta keep our community strong!\n\nUser 3 (SaturdayMorningNostalgia):\nOh, those forums were the best! Had some cool discussions back in the day. Let\u2019s rally for a platform where we can share our love for all things animated!\n\nUser 9 (KirbyStarWarrior):\nDefinitely! Engaging with fellow toon fans makes the experience twice as fun. Eager to see what the new CW4Kids site will bring. Light-hearted fun is good, but I\u2019m all for a space that celebrates every kind of animated awesomeness!\n\nUser 12 (4KidsMod):\nCouldn\u2019t agree more with you all! Your enthusiasm is what fuels this future site. Keep the feedback coming\u2014we want to create a website that you will all enjoy visiting. And, of course, we\u2019ll keep the nostalgia alive while introducing new features for our wonderful community of cartoon aficionados. Stay animated, everyone!\n\nUser 1 (Club Toon Moderator):\nWhew, what a day for CW4Kids! Endings and beginnings all over the place. \u2018Squish\u2019 and \u2018The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers\u2019 have left the block, while \u2018Pokemon\u2019 and \u2018Sonic X\u2019 have officially joined the lineup. And did anyone catch that climactic \u2018Code Lyoko\u2019 episode? XANA\u2019s defeat felt so final!\n\nUser 13 (LyokoFanatic):\nTotally did not expect to feel so many emotions with XANA\u2019s defeat on \u2018Code Lyoko\u2019 today. I heard next week will be a clip show, then we\u2019re into reruns. It\u2019s like saying goodbye to an old friend. I\u2019m not ready.\n\nUser 5 (ToonSquadMember):\nBig day indeed! And that \u2018Scooby-Doo: Mystery Incorporated\u2019 episode\u2014Fred sacrificing the Mystery Machine was low-key heartbreaking. They\u2019re really ramping up to that finale. Also, kudos to the CW4Kids team for those cool show teases during the commercials, It began super intense with Pokemon Horizons and TMNT, but then had a calm light hearted GoGoRiki scene at the end, \n\nUser 7 (DigitalPokeFan003):\nThose show promos had me hyped! Excited to see what\u2019s lined up. But man, \u2018Scooby Doo\u2019 is hitting some serious notes. The next two weeks are going to be intense as they wrap up Professor Pericles\u2019 dark plan. Can\u2019t believe we\u2019re already approaching \u2018Come Undone.'\n\nUser 2 (Anime_Avenger):\nHey, did anyone else feel that today was like a rollercoaster ride of emotions? From highs with \u2018Pokemon\u2019 and \u2018Sonic X\u2019 arriving, to the nostalgic lows with \u2018Code Lyoko.\u2019 And \u2018Scooby Doo\u2019\u2026 man, that got real. Can\u2019t wait to see how they\u2019ll conclude that epic storyline!\n\nUser 9 (KirbyStarWarrior):\nAbsolutely, today was crazy! Seeing \u2018Pokemon\u2019 on the schedule brings back so many memories. And \u2018Sonic X\u2019 joining is just perfect timing. Sad to see \u2018Code Lyoko\u2019 in its final moments, though. That ending! But like everyone else, totally floored by Fred\u2019s choice to destroy the Mystery Machine. That\u2019s commitment!\n\nUser 14 (NewToonWatcher):\nJust started tuning into CW4Kids and what a start it is! Pok\u00e9mon\u2019s a classic, can\u2019t deny that, but I was really pulled in by \u2018Scooby-Doo: Mystery Incorporated.\u2019 That scene with Fred had my jaw on the floor! So, this is the kind of drama I\u2019ve been missing out on?\n\nUser 3 (SaturdayMorningNostalgia):\nYep, NewToonWatcher, welcome to the wild world of CW4Kids! Today felt like a season finale of sorts. \u2018Code Lyoko\u2019 wrapping up, \u2018Scooby-Doo\u2019 on the edge of something huge, and honestly, those teases for the new shows? I\u2019m intrigued. Like a whole new chapter is opening up!\n\nUser 8 (ComicBookJones):\nKudos to CW4Kids for keeping the suspense alive with those teases. New chapters indeed! Though, it\u2019s bittersweet to lose \u2018Code Lyoko.\u2019 And \u2018Scooby-Doo\u2019\u2014it\u2019s like we\u2019re watching them all grow up before our eyes. There\u2019s something special about this era of cartoons, friends.\n\nUser 10 (CartoonConnoisseur):\nAs someone who grew up with the original CW4Kids, it\u2019s heartwarming to see new life being breathed into it\u2014even if it means saying goodbye to some favorites. That \u2018Scooby-Doo\u2019 scene hit different, for sure. Props to CW4Kids for continuing the Saturday morning tradition and keeping it fresh for all of us.\n\nUser 1 (Club Toon Moderator):\nHey toon enthusiasts, big announcements for the next couple of weeks on CW4Kids! Next week, get ready for a schedule shake-up. They\u2019re airing the epic \u201cSpider-Verse\u201d movie that\u2019ll cover the later part of our usual cartoon time. And guess what\u2019s swinging back the week after? \u201cThe Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter\u201d \u2013 and here we thought it might\u2019ve been gone for good!\n\nUser 15 (MultiverseMarvel):\n\u201cSpider-Verse\u201d on CW4Kids is HUGE! That movie was a game-changer for animated superhero films. I\u2019m stoked for newcomers to see it if they missed out. Plus, more Miles Morales is always a win in my book!\n\nUser 9 (KirbyStarWarrior):\nTotally amped for \u201cSpider-Verse,\u201d but let\u2019s talk about \u201cGloopy and Glitter\u201d making a comeback. Didn\u2019t think we\u2019d see them again so soon. Their sparkly antics were sorely missed! Here\u2019s to hoping they\u2019ve got fresh adventures up their sleeves.\n\nUser 3 (SaturdayMorningNostalgia):\n\u201cThe Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter\u201d returning to the lineup feels like finding a lost treasure. Thought we waved goodbye back in November, but CW4Kids is full of surprises. Also, super curious about how they\u2019re gonna fit \u201cSpider-Verse\u201d into the schedule \u2013 a special marathon event, maybe?\n\nUser 4 (TheCartoonCritic):\nAmazing news! \u201cSpider-Verse\u201d is a brilliant move for CW4Kids \u2013 it\u2019s a critical darling and fan fave. As for \u201cGloopy and Glitter,\u201d the hiatus must\u2019ve worked in their favor. Crossing my fingers for a strong return. The show had a charm that was pure CW4Kids magic.\n\nUser 7 (DigitalPokeFan003):\nWhoa! \u201cSpider-Verse\u201d is a must-watch for anyone who hasn\u2019t seen it yet. And I\u2019m hyped about the return of \u201cGloopy and Glitter,\u201d just in time too. Their planet-hopping shenanigans were the perfect mix of silly and awesome.\n\nUser 16 (TooniverseTrekker):\nDid NOT see that coming! \u201cSpider-Verse\u201d is a killer addition to the CW4Kids slate, and \u201cGloopy and Glitter\u201d just tips the excitement scale. Is CW4Kids working on upping their game or what? Between this and the new shows, there\u2019s something special brewing.\n\nUser 2 (Anime_Avenger):\nA bit of a cinematic detour with \u201cSpider-Verse,\u201d then right back to our blobby buddies \u2013 that\u2019s classic CW4Kids unpredictability for you. Can\u2019t wait to see how \u201cGloopy and Glitter\u201d have evolved since their hiatus. This block keeps getting better and better!\n\nUser 10 (CartoonConnoisseur):\nBetween a blockbuster movie event and the return of a beloved series, CW4Kids is really pulling out all the stops. \u201cSpider-Verse\u201d will bring in the viewers, and the comeback of \u201cGloopy and Glitter\u201d right after? That\u2019s just savvy scheduling.\n\nUser 5 (ToonSquadMember):\nI\u2019m delighted about \u201cThe Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter\u201d coming back, but I do hope they haven\u2019t lost their original spark. Long breaks can make you nervous, but also thrilled. And \u201cSpider-Verse\u201d? Well, that speaks for itself!\n\nUser 1 (Club Toon Moderator):\nThe next few weeks look nicely packed with surprises and much-awaited returns. Whether it\u2019s for \u201cSpider-Verse\u201d or \u201cGloopy and Glitter,\u201d make sure to reclaim your spot on the couch. And keep the forum lit with reactions and predictions, folks!

It\u2019s a total overhaul! No more \u201cTeen Titans Go!\u201d or \u201cBatman: The Brave and the Bold,\u201d and \u201cThe Hollow\u201d is gone too. \u201cUltimate Muscle\u201d stepped into the mystery slot after \u201cScooby-Doo.\u201d How\u2019s everyone feeling about this?\n\nUser2: LaughsAndToons\nPosted on February 15, 2023, at 8:45 AM\n\nHonestly? I\u2019m a bit shocked. I knew changes were coming but seeing \u201cTTG\u201d and \u201cBatman\u201d actually gone hits differently. \u201cThe Hollow\u201d leaving wasn\u2019t a surprise, but \u201cUltimate Muscle\u201d is an interesting choice\u2026 Guess it\u2019s full steam ahead into action land on CW4Kids now!\n\nUser3: ScoobyFan1999\nPosted on February 15, 2023, at 9:05 AM\n\nI\u2019m gonna miss \u201cScooby-Doo.\u201d It was the one show that brought me to CW4Kids in the first place. \ud83d\ude22 \u201cUltimate Muscle\u201d has its charm, sure, but nothing fills that mystery gang-shaped hole in my heart.\n\nUser4: SaturdayRetooned\nPosted on February 15, 2023, at 9:40 AM\n\nWhoa, it\u2019s like an end of an era without \u201cTTG\u201d and \u201cBatman.\u201d I grew up with those! Still, \u201cUltimate Muscle\u201d is a nostalgic trip for me. Plus, I\u2019m ready to give \u201cGoGoRiki\u201d a shot. It\u2019s been groomed to take Johnny\u2019s spot, which I\u2019m curious to see how that pans out.\n\nUser5: AnimeAnthology\nPosted on February 15, 2023, at 10:00 AM\n\n\u201cGoGoRiki\u201d stepping up could be cool. We need something light-hearted if everything else is going to be packed with punches and super moves. It\u2019s tough saying goodbye to classics, but I\u2019m rooting for \u201cGoGoRiki\u201d to be our new comedic anchor.\n\nModerator: ToonTimeModerator\nPosted on February 15, 2023, at 10:35 AM\n\nRemember, change is part of the Saturday morning landscape, folks.

With action dominating the block, we need \u201cGoGoRiki\u201d and \u201cGloopy and Glitter\u201d to balance things out.

This is a creative depiction for illustrative purposes only.)\nWrite a TVTropes Screwed By The Network example where (Most shows from Kids WB were screwed over by the blocks transition to The CW4Kids, Some shows like Scooby Doo: Mystery Incorporated and Ultimate Spider-Man were booted off after they had ran out of new episodes, while other like Squish, The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers and Teen Titans Go were kicked randomly, wheras Xiaolin Showdown and Johnny Test held on till the revamp in April, In the odd instance of The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter, which was cancelled by Kids WB, 4Kids reversed the decision)\nScrewed By The Network / Western Animation\n\nThe transition of Kids\u2019 WB to The CW4Kids under the programming management of 4Kids Entertainment was a bumpy road for many fan-favorite shows. While some managed to secure their spot for a while, the destiny of many others was less fortunate, as they seemed to be screwed over by the network.\n\nFor starters, stalwarts like \u201cScooby-Doo: Mystery Incorporated\u201d and \u201cUltimate Spider-Man\u201d enjoyed their run until the well of new episodes dried up. They were then unceremoniously ditched from the lineup, leaving fans in the lurch without their beloved series.\n\nOn the flip side, hits like \u201cSquish,\u201d \u201cThe Amazing Adrenalini Brothers,\u201d and \u201cTeen Titans Go!\u201d fell victim to random expulsion. Despite solid ratings and devoted fanbases, these series were unexpectedly axed with the network offering little to no explanation, leading to speculation about the reasons behind their sudden disappearance.\n\nThere were survivors of the initial culling, though their fate was only delayed. \u201cXiaolin Showdown\u201d and \u201cJohnny Test,\u201d both anchor shows of the erstwhile block, clung on by their fingertips until the April revamp spelled the end of their tenure on The CW4Kids. It was a clear indicator that the new management was steering the block in a different direction, prioritizing their own branded content over the Kids\u2019 WB legacy.\n\nHowever, in a twist befitting the most intricate of animated plots, \u201cThe Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter\u201d experienced a rollercoaster ride with the network. Originally axed by Kids\u2019 WB, indicating a likely bleak future for the blobby duo, the new landlords at 4Kids stepped in and performed a surprise about-face. In a move that delighted fans, 4Kids reversed the cancellation, restoring \u201cGloopy and Glitter\u201d to the lineup and crowning them as one of the block\u2019s flagship shows.\n\nThe stark differences in these shows\u2019 fates highlighted the uncertain world of network television programming where ratings, brand synergy, and management whims can make or break shows, often leaving both their characters and their fans on cliffhangers without resolution.\nWrite a Adored By The Network example saying that Code Lyoko was originally to be removed in April, but was kept, also talk about the flagship shows, and one is an example of Network To The Rescue\nAdored By The Network / Western Animation\n\nWhile many once-beloved series from the Kids\u2019 WB days faced the chopping block during the transition to The CW4Kids, managed by 4Kids Entertainment, \u201cCode Lyoko\u201d emerged as a remarkable exception and stands as a textbook example of being adored by the network.\n\nInitially, \u201cCode Lyoko\u201d seemed destined to share the same fate as its fellow shows, with an April removal marked on the network\u2019s calendar. Fans prepared to bid farewell to the adventures of Jeremie, Aelita, and the rest of the Lyoko Warriors. However, as the dreaded month approached, it became apparent that the network had a change of heart. To the joy and surprise of its dedicated fan base, \u201cCode Lyoko\u201d remained steadfast in its programming slot even beyond the April revamp.\n\nThis decision to hold onto \u201cCode Lyoko\u201d indicated that the show held a special place in the network\u2019s favor, perhaps due to its unique blend of 2D and 3D animation, its engaging storytelling, or its consistent performance with viewers. Ensuring the show\u2019s continued presence amidst the sea of new and returning programs, it became clear that \u201cCode Lyoko\u201d was more than a show for The CW4Kids\u2014it was a treasured jewel.\n\nIn discussing flagship shows adored by the network, \u201cThe Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter\u201d is an exemplary illustration of the \u2018Network to the Rescue\u2019 trope in action. Although they were initially canceled by Kids\u2019 WB, 4Kids Entertainment, recognizing the potential in the series and the love it received from the audience, took the extraordinary step to revive it. Not only was the show brought back to the airwaves, but it was also positioned as one of the block\u2019s leading attractions.\n\n\u201cGoGoRiki,\u201d too, enjoyed an elevated status as a network darling, quickly becoming a cornerstone of the comedy lineup. After taking over the slot from an established favorite (\u201cTeen Titans Go!\u201d), \u201cGoGoRiki\u201d further solidified its standing by later moving into the \u201cJohnny Test\u201d slot, indicating the network\u2019s significant investment in the show\u2019s broad appeal and success.\n\nThese instances show that while the whims and strategies of network executives can often lead to the untimely end of many fan-favorite shows, they can also serve as the saviors for some, providing them with unexpected lifelines and platforms for greater success. In the case of \u201cCode Lyoko,\u201d \u201cThe Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter,\u201d and \u201cGoGoRiki,\u201d The CW4Kids indeed showed a level of adoration that would secure these series\u2019 legacies for years to come.\n\nForum Thread Title: \u201cKids\u2019 WB October 2022 Schedule - Future Predictions?\u201d\n\nUser1: TooniverseTim\nPosted on October 5, 2022, at 7:54 PM\n\nHey fellow animation aficionados!

They\u2019re like the backbone of modern \u2018toon comedy on Kids\u2019 WB. I hope they replace them with shows of equal caliber. Also, \u201cXiaolin Showdown\u201d feels so nostalgic.

That\u2019s quite the heads-up, but \u201cGumball\u201d has had a great run, and \u201cCraig of the Creek\u201d is consistently good. Still, I\u2019m stoked \u201cCode Lyoko\u201d and \u201cScooby-Doo: Mystery Incorporated\u201d are holding strong\u2014quality picks right there.\n\nUser5: WBAnimationFan\nPosted on October 5, 2022, at 9:30 PM\n\nTrue, it\u2019s sad to hear about \u201cGumball\u201d and \u201cCraig,\u201d but \u201cThe Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter\u201d is such a breath of fresh air! I have high hopes for it to take the comedy reigns. Also, is anyone else loving the resurgence of \u201cBatman: The Brave and the Bold\u201d?\n\nModerator: KidsWB_Mod\nPosted on October 5, 2022, at 9:55 PM\n\nEvening, folks! Let\u2019s remember that schedules are always subject to change, and nothing\u2019s set in stone. \u201cGumball\u201d and \u201cCraig of the Creek\u201d have been phenomenal series for Kids\u2019 WB, and we love them as much as you do.

Plus, \u201cTeen Titans Go!\u201d and \u201cUltimate Spider-Man\u201d always deliver, so I\u2019m feeling optimistic!\n\nUser7: ToonTalker\nPosted on October 5, 2022, at 10:45 PM\n\nI think I speak for a lot of us when I say that losing \u201cGumball\u201d would be the end of an era. I\u2019ve grown up with that show! \u201cCraig of the Creek\u201d is a hit in our household too. They\u2019ve knocked it out of the park with these programs, so here\u2019s hoping Kids\u2019 WB has some aces up their sleeves for the next lineup.

Kids\u2019 WB has a knack for keeping things fresh while still respecting the classics. Losing \u201cGumball\u201d and \u201cCraig\u201d would be tough, but if \u201cThe Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter\u201d is any indicator, I\u2019m sure we\u2019ve got some awesome toons on the horizon. Times change, and so do schedules. Let\u2019s enjoy our faves while we can and look to the future of our beloved Kids\u2019 WB!

The station name\u2019s changing, and we\u2019ll see incremental updates in the coming months. Man, I remember when \u201cThe Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter,\u201d \u201cUltimate Spider-Man,\u201d and \u201cScooby-Doo: Mystery Incorporated\u201d were added back in September 2022. And then how \u201cThe Amazing World of Gumball\u201d and \u201cCraig of the Creek\u201d got switched out for \u201cThe Amazing Adrenalini Brothers\u201d and \u201cSquish\u201d this January\u2026 2022/2023 was a crazy year for Kids\u2019 WB. And now it\u2019s almost all over. Thoughts?\n\nUser2: SaturdayMorningMaster\nPosted on November 8, 2023, at 8:50 AM\n\nI\u2019m feeling pretty nostalgic, Tim. Kids\u2019 WB has been a constant in my life since\u2026 well, forever. Excited yet uneasy about what 4Kids will bring to the table. Will they respect our favorites or is everything we love about Kids\u2019 WB going to vanish?\n\nUser3: ClassicToonGal\nPosted on November 8, 2023, at 9:15 AM\n\nChange is always scary, but sometimes it can bring cool surprises. Remember the 4Kids lineup from the early 2000s? They had some hits! I\u2019ll miss Kids\u2019 WB for sure, but I\u2019m going to keep an open mind about this whole rebranding thing. Fingers crossed they do right by us!\n\nUser4: AnimationAdmirer\nPosted on November 8, 2023, at 9:45 AM\n\nIt\u2019s kind of the end of an era, isn\u2019t it? But let\u2019s be fair, Kids\u2019 WB has been evolving over the years. \u201cScooby-Doo: MI\u201d was such a refreshing new take for the franchise. As long as quality content continues, I\u2019m in. But, let\u2019s not forget that 4Kids can be\u2026 controversial, to say the least.\n\nUser5: DigitalDrew92\nPosted on November 8, 2023, at 10:00 AM\n\nGotta admit, I wasn\u2019t ready for this news. I\u2019m not just worried about the shows, but what about the branding, the vibe? Kids\u2019 WB had a special feel to it, you know? 4Kids has big shoes to fill. Hope they start off by actually listening to the fans.\n\nModerator: WBToonMod\nPosted on November 8, 2023, at 10:25 AM\n\nEveryone, let\u2019s remember there\u2019s always a silver lining. Kids\u2019 WB has been paving the way for quality programming for years. Though the impending changes have raised some eyebrows, we\u2019re optimistic 4Kids is aware of the community\u2019s attachment and will do their utmost to enhance the experience. Stay tuned for announcements and share any news as it comes!\n\nUser6: NostalgicNick\nPosted on November 8, 2023, at 11:30 AM\n\nIt\u2019s bittersweet, but you can\u2019t stop progress, I guess. \u201cThe Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter\u201d was a pleasant surprise that grew on me, and \u201cUltimate Spider-Man\u201d Was a funny take on our favourite web-slinging superhero.

At least that\u2019s what I\u2019m hoping for!\n\nUser8: TheToonFanatic\nPosted on November 8, 2023, at 1:05 PM\n\nJust when I had the schedule memorized\u2026 \ud83d\ude44 But hey, maybe this is a positive shakeup? A good mix of the old and new could keep things fresh. I\u2019m willing to ride this transition out and see where it takes us. Endings are tough, but who knows what cool shows this change might bring?\n\nUser9: AnimationIsLife\nPosted on November 8, 2023, at 1:45 PM\n\nI\u2019m torn. Sure, new shows could be awesome. Still, Kids\u2019 WB was iconic! Losing \u201cThe Amazing World of Gumball\u201d and \u201cCraig of the Creek\u201d felt like the beginning of the end. Honestly, I just hope 4Kids keeps some of the Kid\u2019s WB spirit alive in whatever they plan to do next.\n\nUser1: ToonTalkerTim\nPosted on November 8, 2023, at 2:00 PM\n\nAll we can do is wait and watch.

Kids\u2019 WB\u2019s rebrand under 4Kids is official, and the new station name is \u201cCW4Kids\u201d! Interestingly enough, my local CW affiliate is bringing \u201cCW4Kids\u201d to Sundays in the next few weeks because \u201cToonattik\u201d is taking over the Saturday morning slot, which is big news since it features \u201cYu-Gi-Oh! Arc-V,\u201d a series we haven\u2019t seen on Kids\u2019 WB. Schedule-wise, they say it\u2019s sticking for now, but we can expect incremental changes till February to let \u201cCode Lyoko,\u201d \u201cScooby-Doo,\u201d and \u201cSpider-Man\u201d wrap up their current episodes. Though, did anyone else catch that \u201cScooby-Doo\u201d marathon last month? Feels like they might be accelerating the end of \u201cMystery Inc.\u201d\n\nUser2: SaturdayMorningMaster\nPosted on December 3, 2023, at 8:30 AM\n\nCW4Kids, huh? That takes me back. Good to know they\u2019re being considerate with the shows currently airing, allowing them to finish properly. But I did catch that \u201cScooby-Doo\u201d marathon\u2014seems like they\u2019re burning off episodes. I\u2019m guessing they\u2019ll do the same for others if they\u2019re impatient to start the new lineup.\n\nUser3: 4KidsFaithful\nPosted on December 3, 2023, at 9:10 AM\n\nWow, a Sunday slot for CW4Kids is kinda cool, actually! Gives us two mornings of cartoons. \u201cYu-Gi-Oh! Arc-V\u201d on \u201cToonattik\u201d is an unexpected treat. Looks like they\u2019re mixing things up right from the start. About the current shows\u2026 ever since \u201cGloopy and Glitter\u201d got its send-off marathons, I\u2019ve been bracing for a sweep. Gotta enjoy \u201cCode Lyoko\u201d and the rest while we still can!\n\nUser4: ScoobySquadMember\nPosted on December 3, 2023, at 9:45 AM\n\nAs a \u201cScooby-Doo\u201d enthusiast, I\u2019m split between being glad we got a marathon and concerned they\u2019re trying to wrap up the series too fast. Hopefully, they\u2019ll honor the remaining episodes with proper scheduling. Not thrilled about a rushed finish to \u201cMystery Inc.\u201d\n\nUser5: NewEraToonFan\nPosted on December 3, 2023, at 10:00 AM\n\nSo it begins\u2026 CW4Kids. Across both days? That marathon did feel like a burn-off for \u201cScooby.\u201d Strategic? Maybe. All I can say is I hope \u201cCode Lyoko\u201d doesn\u2019t get the same treatment. They better not cut \u201cUltimate Spider-Man\u201d short either\u2014if they\u2019ve got episodes to finish, let\u2019s see them through!\n\nModerator: CWtoonMod\nPosted on December 3, 2023, at 10:35 AM\n\nJust a quick reminder, gang\u2014let\u2019s stay on topic and keep to what we know for sure. \u201cToonattik\u201d with \u201cYu-Gi-Oh! Arc-V\u201d is officially added to Saturday mornings, and yes, CW4Kids programming will shift to Sundays soon for some affiliates. We\u2019re also committed to presenting the remaining episodes of current shows before any substantial schedule changes happen.

As for the current lineup, I\u2019m hopeful they wrap things up respectfully, but that \u201cScooby\u201d marathon has me guessing we won\u2019t have \u201cMystery Inc.\u201d till February as proposed. Crossing fingers they don\u2019t rush \u201cCode Lyoko\u201d!\n\nUser7: RetroRanger\nPosted on December 3, 2023, at 12:00 PM\n\nSeems like CW4Kids is laying the groundwork for big changes. \u201cToonattik\u201d is a nice surprise, but let\u2019s not overlook the impact on our current faves. If they\u2019re trying to usher in a new era, I get it, but let\u2019s savor the classics a bit longer. A marathon for \u201cScooby\u201d was nice, but it\u2019s got me worried about goodbye pacing for the other long-runners.\n\nUser8: TheToonFanatic\nPosted on December 3, 2023, at 1:30 PM\n\nMixed feelings here. CW4Kids on Sundays means double the fun, but also signals serious shifts on the horizon. Here\u2019s hoping they aren\u2019t just burning off episodes to expedite the rebrand. And let\u2019s be real, marathons can be fun, but they can also mean \u201cwe\u2019re speeding to the finish line.\u201d I want a proper finale for \u201cCode Lyoko,\u201d not a rushed conclusion.\n\nUser9: AnimationIsLife\nPosted on December 3, 2023, at 2:10 PM\n\nRegardless of our attachment to the shows, I suppose we should embrace the new direction under CW4Kids. Marathons and schedule changes can be bittersweet, yet they could be necessary for transitioning to the fresh lineup. As long as they\u2019re treating our current beloved shows with dignity, I\u2019m onboard. Here\u2019s to a respectful send-off for \u201cCode Lyoko,\u201d \u201cScooby,\u201d and \u201cSpider-Man,\u201d and to a new chapter with CW4Kids!\n\nUser1: ToonTalkerTim\nPosted on December 3, 2023, at 2:35 PM\n\nAbsolutely, let\u2019s keep the love going for the shows we\u2019ve enjoyed for years, and welcome the newcomers with open arms.

I enjoyed the laughs from \u201cLamput\u201d and the quirky creativity of \u201cPlanet Sketch.\u201d Still, \u201cGoGoWiki\u201d sounds like a neat way to dive deeper into \u201cGoGoRiki.\u201d As for \u201cPikachu\u2019s Jukebox,\u201d you can\u2019t go wrong with Pok\u00e9mon tunes \u2013 they\u2019re classics!\n\nUser3: 4KidsFaithful\nPosted on March 6, 2024, at 7:15 AM\n\nGotta admit, I\u2019ll miss \u201cLamput\u2019s\u201d absurdity and \u201cPlanet Sketch\u2019s\u201d antics. They were great palette cleansers between shows. \u201cGoGoWiki\u201d could be educational though? Could add another layer to the \u201cGoGoRiki\u201d experience.

With \u201cThe Amazing World of Gumball\u201d and \u201cCraig of the Creek\u201d booted off the list since January, I\u2019ve been crunching some numbers to see which show\u2019s been drawing in the viewers.

Our team at 4Kids Entertainment has been diligently working to ensure a seamless transition that respects the legacy of Kids\u2019 WB while introducing a refreshed and engaging lineup tailored to our young audience.\n\nAs we approach the December 31st timeline, we would like to confirm our plan to officially change the block name to CW4Kids. Alongside this rebranding, we are implementing incremental scheduling updates leading up to our major rebrand launch in mid-April. This will allow us to slowly introduce new series from the 4Kids catalog and to test audience reception to various content formats and arrangements.\n\nDuring this transition, we will maintain the distinctive comic book-style bumpers and aesthetic developed by Kids\u2019 WB, in an effort to preserve a sense of continuity and familiarity for the viewers. This visual style will be replaced with a fresh and contemporary look coinciding with the full spectrum launch of CW4Kids in mid-April.\n\nThe following flagship shows from 4Kids will spearhead our new programming direction:\n\n- \u201cGoGoRiki\u201d \u2013 A delightful, light-hearted animated series that is set to become a cornerstone of our comedic lineup.\n- \u201cYu-Gi-Oh! Arc-V\u201d \u2013 The latest installment in the globally popular franchise, continuing the tradition of exciting duel-centric adventures.\n- \u201cViva Pi\u00f1ata\u201d \u2013 A vibrant animated series based on the popular video game that brings a fun-filled world to our viewers.\n\nAdditionally, we will carry over two shows from the existing Kids\u2019 WB lineup all the way through to the April rebrand to maintain continuity for our audience.

Following our previous correspondence, we at 4Kids Entertainment continue to refine and enhance the CW4Kids programming slate in preparation for our mid-April relaunch.\n\nHaving carefully considered the current Kids\u2019 WB lineup and the response from audiences, we have decided to incorporate one particularly well-received show into the permanent CW4Kids lineup as a flagship series. It is with great excitement that we announce the retention of \u201cThe Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter\u201d as a mainstay of our new programming block.\n\n\u201cThe Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter\u201d has consistently shown its ability to capture the imagination of our young viewers with its creative storytelling, dynamic characters, and unique style. The universal themes and engaging content have not only resonated with current fans but also demonstrate significant potential to attract new audiences to the CW4Kids block.\n\nWith the intent of building upon its success, we plan to give \u201cThe Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter\u201d a prominent position in our schedule. We are fully committed to supporting its production, ensuring the highest quality of future episodes, and integrating the series into our marketing and branding efforts as a representation of the innovative spirit of CW4Kids.\n\nWe believe that maintaining this element of continuity from the Kids\u2019 WB era is not only a nod to the cherished history of Saturday morning cartoons but also a strategic move that underscores our commitment to high-caliber and beloved programming.\n\nFurther details about the integration process, including scheduling and promotional activities, will be shared with you shortly. We are confident that this decision will be favorably received by our audience and will become a significant draw for our rebranded block.\n\nOnce again, we value our partnership with The CW and appreciate your input as we move forward. Together, we look forward to both preserving the legacy of Saturday mornings and forging a new path that excites and delights.\n\nWarm regards,\n\n[Your Name]\nDirector of Programming Strategy\n4Kids Entertainment\n\nForum Thread Title: \u201cCW4Kids Web Presence Gearing Up \u2013 Games & Points Added!\u201d\n\nUser1: ToonTalkerTim\nPosted on February 14, 2024, at 10:45 AM\n\nJust dropped in on the CW4Kids site and spotted something interesting. They\u2019re rolling out games now, kind of like the old 4kids.tv days. Plus, they\u2019ve got this 4Kids Points feature going on which is nostalgic for sure.

Just checked it out and it\u2019s a blast from the past with those gaming features\u2014really getting those 4Kids vibes again. 4Kids Points, huh? Could be fun if they\u2019ve got cool rewards like exclusive wallpapers or digital cards.

Just hoping the games are more diverse and interactive than before.\n\nUser5: SaturdayMorningMaster\nPosted on February 14, 2024, at 12:30 PM\n\nDefinitely digging the inclusion of games, reminds me a lot of the original 4Kids website.

But the site definitely needs that overhaul if they want to keep up with today\u2019s internet standards. As for the 4Kids Points feature, I\u2019m intrigued. Could be a good engagement tool if handled well. Hope the updated site keeps the interactive and community vibe strong.\n\nUser7: AnimationIsLife\nPosted on February 14, 2024, at 2:00 PM\n\nThis is a cool start! I was a big fan of the old 4kids.tv games, so I\u2019m excited to see what they bring to the table for CW4Kids. However, they\u2019ll need more than just a nostalgic points system to make the site stand out.

As of next week, Warner Bros. is officially stepping back from any control over the CW4Kids block. The whole operation is being handed over to 4Kids Entertainment. Seems like WB\u2019s Kids\u2019 WB era is truly coming to an end. How\u2019s everyone feeling about this complete handover?\n\nUser2: DigitalDrew92\nPosted on March 1, 2024, at 9:20 AM\n\nHonestly? It\u2019s a little surreal. WB has been at the helm for so long, it\u2019s tough to imagine the block without them. I\u2019ve got this mix of anticipation and anxiety about how 4Kids will navigate on their own. I just hope they keep the essence of those epic Saturday mornings.\n\nUser3: RetroToonRewind\nPosted on March 1, 2024, at 9:40 AM\n\nThis is huge! I\u2019m cautiously optimistic, though. WB set a high bar, and while 4Kids has had some hits, they\u2019ve also had their share of missteps. All eyes on them now. Let\u2019s see if they can maintain the quality while bringing their own flavor.\n\nUser4: 90sCartoonKid\nPosted on March 1, 2024, at 10:05 AM\n\nGotta say, it marks the end of an era but could be the start of something fresh.

Noticed during the latest promos that the Eric TTS voice we\u2019ve gotten used to since 2018 is getting replaced by 4KidsTV\u2019s announcers. Looks like they\u2019re starting to put their stamp on things. Yet, Eric\u2019s still holding down the fort in the bumpers\u2026for now. Anyone else catch this change?\n\nUser2: DigitalDrew92\nPosted on March 15, 2024, at 10:55 AM\n\nHeard about this, too. That text-to-speech voice had a sort of staple quality to it but can understand why 4Kids would want to switch to their own announcers. Brings back the more traditional feel of Saturday mornings, I guess. Curious to see if and when they\u2019ll transition the bumpers as well.\n\nUser3: RetroToonRewind\nPosted on March 15, 2024, at 11:10 AM\n\nYep, I caught those new voices during the promos\u2014gave me a serious throwback moment.

It\u2019s already got that digital theme which ties in perfectly with the new aesthetic they\u2019re pushing. Aside from \u201cThe Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter,\u201d it\u2019s one of the few Kids\u2019 WB holdovers. Gotta hand it to 4Kids for strategic show retention!

It seems less about nostalgia and more about synergy with their new direction. Plus, \u201cLyoko\u201d has that timeless feel that both new and returning viewers can get into. As for \u201cGloopy and Glitter,\u201d its unique charm might be the appeal for its survival.\n\nUser3: RetroToonRewind\nPosted on March 17, 2024, at 10:50 AM\n\nMakes a lot of sense. \u201cCode Lyoko\u201d has that futuristic vibe that\u2019s spot on for the relaunch. Seems like 4Kids is playing a well-thought-out game of chess with their scheduling and show selections. \u201cGloopy and Glitter\u201d likely stayed because it adds variety \u2013 can\u2019t have too much of one thing, even if the theme is \u2018digital.\u2019\n\nUser4: 90sCartoonKid\nPosted on March 17, 2024, at 11:30 AM\n\n\u201cLyoko\u201d might just find itself gaining an even larger cult following with the new branding. It has the right mix of action and tech intrigue which is more relevant than ever. \u201cThe Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter,\u201d on the other hand, is that breath of fresh air among all the tech-centric shows.\n\nUser5: AnimationAce\nPosted on March 17, 2024, at 12:15 PM\n\nNot gonna lie, I was shocked that \u201cCode Lyoko\u201d cut it while other staples didn\u2019t. But this all makes sense now. The digital approach of CW4Kids needed shows with themes that mesh well with it, and Lyoko was it. \u201cGloopy and Glitter\u201d adds the necessary balance, showcasing their keen strategy.\n\nModerator: CWtoonMod\nPosted on March 17, 2024, at 1:00 PM\n\nYou\u2019re all spot-on with your insights! \u201cCode Lyoko\u201d has much to contribute to the technological ethos we\u2019re embracing, while \u201cGloopy and Glitter\u201d ensures we preserve that diverse content diversity.

It was ahead of its time with its blend of 2D/3D animation and it\u2019s paying off. It\u2019s this kind of forward-thinking that might just redefine CW4Kids and keep them competitive. \u201cGloopy and Glitter\u201d proves they\u2019re not all about pixels and programs.

Not sure about \u201cWorld of Quest,\u201d but I\u2019ll give it a shot!\n\nUser5: HeroHype\nPosted on May 1, 2023, at 10:30 AM\n\nYeah, the absence of \u201cBatman: The Brave and the Bold\u201d and \u201cUltimate Spider-Man\u201d is noticeable. They had a good run last season though! \u201cThe Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter\u201d is still hanging in there, too, which gives us some fun to look forward to.\n\nModerator: SaturdayToonMod\nPosted on May 1, 2023, at 11:00 AM\n\nReminder to keep the conversation respectful, folks! Lots of changes true, but let\u2019s stay optimistic and see how these new titles develop. Remember, new seasons of Batman, Spider-Man, and Scooby could be on the horizon, so stay tuned!\n\nUser6: ClassicToonFan\nPosted on May 1, 2023, at 11:30 AM\n\nI\u2019m willing to give \u201cWorld of Quest\u201d a fair chance\u2014could be a dark horse in the lineup. \u201cOzzy and Drix\u201d is a surprising choice but it has its moments. \u201cJohnny Test\u201d is the cornerstone of constant chaos, so at least some things never change!\n\nUser7: RetroToonRewind\nPosted on May 1, 2023, at 12:00 PM\n\nThe new schedule is quite the shakeup but I\u2019m intrigued by \u201cSkatoony.\u201d Its mix of live-action and animation could be a fun pivot from the usual. Miss the action block of \u201cBatman\u201d and \u201cSpider-Man\u201d though. Big shoes for \u201cWorld of Quest\u201d to fill if it\u2019s trying to capture that same audience.\n\nUser8: AnimationAfficionado\nPosted on May 1, 2023, at 12:45 PM\n\nAs much as I love new content, there were no goodbyes to classics like \u201cBatman: The Brave and the Bold,\u201d \u201cUltimate Spider-Man,\u201d and \u201cScooby-Doo: MI.\u201d Fingers crossed for their return. Here\u2019s hoping \u201cWorld of Quest\u201d brings something fresh to the table.

Just read an announcement from Warner Bros Discovery, and it\u2019s not looking good for Kids\u2019 WB. They\u2019re saying that kids \u201cdon\u2019t watch cartoons anymore\u201d and are more interested in YouTube, Roblox, and TikTok. It sounds like they\u2019re ready to write the block off for taxes. The website has gone super basic, now on Weebly of all things! Anyone else hearing those rumors about 4Kids though?\n\nUser2: RetroRobloxian\nPosted on October 25, 2023, at 10:20 AM\n\nI\u2019m gutted! Kids\u2019 WB has been such a staple. But I\u2019ve also caught wind of those rumors, they\u2019re saying 4Kids might be looking to take over. Could be our silver lining if true. They\u2019ve had their own issues in the past, but maybe they can bring new life to our Saturday mornings.\n\nUser3: DigitalStreamer\nPosted on October 25, 2023, at 10:45 AM\n\nHonestly, it feels like Warner Bros Discovery is out of touch. Sure, screens are changing, but Saturday morning cartoons are still special. Weebly of all places though? That\u2019s quite the downgrade. I\u2019d welcome 4Kids at this point if it saves the shows.\n\nUser4: AnimationAdvocate\nPosted on October 25, 2023, at 11:10 AM\n\nThe Warner Bros Discovery statement is disheartening. There\u2019s still a charm to traditional cartoons that other platforms can\u2019t capture. Seeing Kids\u2019 WB end up on Weebly is sad. But 4Kids stepping in\u2026 could it be a beacon of hope?\n\nUser5: CartoonConspiracy\nPosted on October 25, 2023, at 11:35 AM\n\nThis feels like giving up on a legacy. Kids do watch TV, just maybe not as traditional as before. But I\u2019m also wondering just how credible these \u201crumors\u201d are about 4Kids. Are we sure this isn\u2019t just wishful thinking?\n\nModerator: KidsWBTalk\nPosted on October 25, 2023, at 12:00 PM\n\nQuick reminder to keep discussions speculative but hopeful. Warner Bros Discovery\u2019s move is business after all. If the rumors about 4Kids are true, we may see an interesting turn of events. Stay positive, folks!\n\nUser6: SaturdaySurfer\nPosted on October 25, 2023, at 12:30 PM\n\nMan, the Weebly website kind of confirmed my fears. Still, 4Kids making a comeback\u2014even if just a rumor\u2014has me hyped! Could you imagine the likes of \u201cYu-Gi-Oh!\u201d and \u201cPok\u00e9mon\u201d filling our Saturday mornings again?\n\nUser7: ToonSkeptic\nPosted on October 25, 2023, at 1:00 PM\n\nWow, what a throwback, could be cool or a disaster. Kids\u2019 WB was about variety, and 4Kids was\u2026 a mixed bag. I just hope that if they step in, they don\u2019t only stick to their old titles. We need the diversity that Kids\u2019 WB brought us over the years.\n\nUser8: PixelPatty\nPosted on October 25, 2023, at 1:30 PM\n\nHonestly, this could be a turning point. The Warner Bros Discovery mindset is a sign of the times, but nostalgia is strong with cartoons. 4Kids buying the block? It might just work. Let\u2019s not forget, they pioneered a lot of our childhood classics. Here\u2019s to hoping!\n\nUser9: NostalgiaNerd\nPosted on October 25, 2023, at 2:00 PM\n\nThe thought of losing Kids\u2019 WB is hard to swallow, but I\u2019m excited at these whispers of 4Kids.

Perfect balance of action and comedy. And \u201cGoGoRiki\u201d definitely surprised me with its charm. \u201cCode Lyoko\u201d and \u201cXiaolin Showdown\u201d are still holding their own too! Solid episodes today.\n\nUser3: ToonHero93\nPosted on February 17, 2024, at 12:30 PM\n\nBig fan of the reboot vibes today, especially with \u201cGoGoRiki.\u201d \u201cUltimate Muscle\u201d is a nostalgic kick, while \u201cSonic X\u201d is always a speedy classic on the list.

It has that classic 4Kids era vibe. \u201cGoGoRiki\u201d is pretty wacky but in a good way. \u201cCode Lyoko\u201d is still my top pick though \u2013 that mixture of 2D/3D animation and the plot line in today\u2019s episode were spot on!\n\nModerator: CW4Kids_Mod\nPosted on February 17, 2024, at 1:55 PM\n\nLoving the reactions, pals!

Have you spotted the latest bumper on CW4Kids yesterday? In between \u201cCode Lyoko\u201d and \u201cXiaolin Showdown,\u201d there was this brand new one that debuted. It\u2019s a break from the usual comic bumpers and featured characters from \u201cGoGoRiki,\u201d \u201cThe Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter,\u201d and \u201cSonic X\u201d in cool action poses!

The transition isn\u2019t jarring, which is nice, but seeing some old favorites officially not making the cut is a little tough. It\u2019s the end of an era, for sure. But, I guess we have to trust that CW4Kids knows what they\u2019re doing with this new lineup.\n\nUser3: SaturdayMorningMaven\nPosted on March 1, 2024, at 10:55 AM\n\nI\u2019ve been holding out hope for a comeback of some of those shows since the rumors started flying.

That being said, I am curious to experience the fully realized vision of CW4Kids in April.\n\nUser4: AnimationAficionado\nPosted on March 1, 2024, at 11:10 AM\n\nAs nostalgic as I am for the old lineup, I\u2019ve been intrigued by the gradual introduction of new content. It\u2019s been a gentle passing of the torch. Yet, with mid-April leaving no room for previous shows, it sends a strong signal that CW4Kids is forging its own path.\n\nUser5: TooniverseExplorer\nPosted on March 1, 2024, at 11:30 AM\n\nCan\u2019t say I\u2019m not disappointed. \u201cTeen Titans Go\u201d and \u201cUltimate Spider-Man\u201d had become staples. But on the other hand, change fuels innovation. I\u2019m excited to see how shows like \u201cGoGoRiki\u201d and \u201cGloopy and Glitter\u201d define the network moving forward.\n\nModerator: CW4KidsWatch\nPosted on March 1, 2024, at 11:45 AM\n\nIt\u2019s understandable to feel a mix of emotions during such transitions.

Noticed some swanky new changes that seem to be bridging towards the full 4kids.tv aesthetic. The site\u2019s typeface got a style upgrade, and we now have the old 4Kids header\u2014quite the facelift from that Weebly template. This partial update has me itching for the full redirect.

Surprising choice by CW4Kids given the history, but I\u2019m guessing they\u2019ve got the modified version without the problematic scene.

Interested to see this play out\u2014CW4Kids seems to be all about surprises these days, Also, It wasn't confirmed Squish and TAAB have no chance of returning, but why are we so doubtful they will, Is it because there is no room on the schedule for them? Also, why didn't World of Quest continue after September 2023, because Ultimate Spider-Man, Squish and B:TBATB didn't premiere any new episodes, The only shows that actually were premiering were TAOG&G, TTG, CL and SDMI, I think Batman should have been replaced with Quest, Forum Thread Title: \u201cCW4Kids New Direction \u2013 Speculation on Show Returns\u201d\n\nUser1: ToonMaven\nPosted on March 2, 2024, at 7:45 AM\n\nWith all the shifts happening at CW4Kids, I can\u2019t help but wonder about \u201cSquish\u201d and \u201cThe Amazing Adrenalini Brothers.\u201d They were cut in January, and with the new lineup solidifying, does anyone else feel like there\u2019s no chance for their return? Could it be a space issue in the schedule, or maybe they\u2019re just not the right fit for this new CW4Kids image?\n\nUser2: RetroToonFan\nPosted on March 2, 2024, at 8:05 AM\n\nYeah, it feels like CW4Kids is moving forward and not looking back. \u201cSquish\u201d and \u201cTAAB\u201d getting the early boot makes it seem like they\u2019re clearing the deck for the new tech-themed line-up. Maybe they just don\u2019t mesh with the \u201call-new\u201d digital vibe they\u2019re aiming for.\n\nUser3: SaturdayMorningForever\nPosted on March 2, 2024, at 8:30 AM\n\nThere\u2019s something about \u201cWorld of Quest\u201d not continuing on Kids\u2019 WB after September 2023 that\u2019s always bugged me. It had a solid fan base and fit the action-adventure slot well. Maybe it just fell victim to the bigger programming overhaul. If it didn\u2019t make the cut back then, the chances are slim now with CW4Kids\u2019 new direction.\n\nUser4: DigitalDetective\nPosted on March 2, 2024, at 9:00 AM\n\nI\u2019ve got a theory on \u201cWorld of Quest\u201d \u2013 perhaps it didn\u2019t align with the future plans Warner Bros had in mind, which might explain its absence even when other shows were still premiering. As for \u201cSquish\u201d and \u201cTAAB,\u201d their removal coincided with the branching out to new themes, hence their likely permanent departure from the lineup.\n\nUser5: AnimationAnalyst\nPosted on March 2, 2024, at 9:45 AM\n\nConsidering how early \u201cSquish\u201d and \u201cTAAB\u201d were removed, it\u2019s not surprising they haven\u2019t made a comeback with the mid-April schedule. CW4Kids seems committed to their \u201call-new\u201d strategy, and there might not be room for shows that represent the former era of Kids\u2019 WB. They\u2019ve made their bet on the future, and sadly, some shows just won\u2019t be part of it.\n\nUser6: CartoonCognoscenti\nPosted on March 2, 2024, at 10:15 AM\n\nNot gonna lie, I had a glimmer of hope that \u201cSquish\u201d or \u201cTAAB\u201d might surprise us with a return, given how \u201cCode Lyoko\u201d and \u201cThe Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter\u201d stuck around. But with CW4Kids\u2019 current trajectory, it feels like those shows are part of the old guard that\u2019s being left behind.\n\nUser7: ToonSpectator\nPosted on March 2, 2024, at 11:00 AM\n\n\u201cWorld of Quest\u201d had such potential; it\u2019s a mystery why it didn\u2019t continue post-September 2023. Could\u2019ve been ratings or just not aligning with the upcoming vision. As for the other shows, CW4Kids\u2019 new era does seem to be saying a final goodbye to the past, placing its bets on new content to drive the block forward.\n\nUser8: NostalgicNick\nPosted on March 2, 2024, at 12:30 PM\n\nIt\u2019s disheartening, but all signs point to a permanent exit for \u201cSquish,\u201d \u201cTAAB,\u201d and \u201cWorld of Quest.\u201d CW4Kids is crafting its own legacy now, and sometimes that means hard cuts. Maybe we can hope for reruns at some point, but for now, it looks like those shows are part of Kids\u2019 WB\u2019s final chapter.\nWrite a follow up where they are running out of comedic shows, with only 3 currently on the lineup, with Viva Pinata set to replace one of them in mid-April, One user says one slot could go to The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers but they doubt it, considering they have a lot of action based shows coming, and there isn\u2019t much room, Also, they say WOQ should have stayed for the final few months of KWB, because only a few shows were premiering new eps, but they say it probably would have left with Squish and the Adrenalinis, or the Titans in mid-Feb\nForum Thread Title: \u201cCW4Kids\u2019 Comedy Crunch \u2013 The Quest for More Laughs\u201d\n\nUser1: ToonTimeTyler\nPosted on March 3, 2024, at 10:20 AM\n\nI\u2019ve been looking at the upcoming CW4Kids schedule, and it\u2019s glaring how we\u2019re running low on comedy shows. After mid-April, \u201cViva Pi\u00f1ata\u201d is set to take over one of the few comedy slots we have left. With \u201cGoGoRiki\u201d and \u201cThe Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter\u201d as our only mainstays, could this be the perfect time to bring back \u201cThe Amazing Adrenalini Brothers\u201d? Though, with the influx of action shows, I doubt there\u2019s much room. They seem focused on building an action-packed lineup.\n\nUser2: LaughTrackLucy\nPosted on March 3, 2024, at 10:45 AM\n\nYou read my mind, Tyler. \u201cThe Amazing Adrenalini Brothers\u201d could provide that comedic element we\u2019re craving, but I\u2019m skeptical too. CW4Kids seems to be doubling down on action, and I\u2019m not sure they see \u201cAdrenalinis\u201d fitting into their new aesthetic.

Had it hung in there until the final months of Kids\u2019 WB, it could\u2019ve provided some much-needed variety alongside the limited new episodes from the other shows. But, if we\u2019re being honest, it probably would\u2019ve left when \u201cSquish\u201d and the \u201cAdrenalinis\u201d did\u2014or even with \u201cTeen Titans Go!\u201d in February.\n\nUser4: SitcomSam\nPosted on March 3, 2024, at 11:30 AM\n\nI guess we can only dream of the \u201cAdrenalinis\u201d making a comeback. CW4Kids appears to have a clear strategy, and nostalgia doesn\u2019t seem to be part of it. It\u2019s starting to look like a one-sided battle between comedy and action\u2014and action is winning. Maybe they\u2019ll surprise us down the line with a new comedic acquisition?\n\nUser5: ToonTownTommy\nPosted on March 3, 2024, at 12:00 PM\n\nEven if CW4Kids wanted to add \u201cTAAB\u201d back, the schedules are pretty tight with the new shows rolling in. Plus, with \u201cViva Pi\u00f1ata\u201d poised to replace one more comedic show, the space is indeed limited.

While action is undeniably a significant part of the CW4Kids identity right now, it doesn\u2019t mean comedy will be neglected in the long term. Though there might not be room at the moment for shows like \u201cThe Amazing Adrenalini Brothers,\u201d the programming team is always looking for ways to keep our lineup diverse and engaging.

Here\u2019s a quick comparison with early March data after the transition:\n\nCW4Kids (March 2, 2024) (Live + SD Data):\n- Pok\u00e9mon: Indigo League: 1.9\n- GoGoRiki: 1.4\n- Ultimate Muscle: 1.3\n- Code Lyoko: 2.3\n- Xiaolin Showdown: 1.2\n- The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter: 1.8\n- Sonic X: 2.0\n- Kirby: Right Back At Ya!: 1.5\n- Johnny Test: 1.7\n- Ultimate Spider-Man: 1.1\n\nUser2: RetroToonNostalgia\nPosted on March 4, 2024, at 9:45 AM\n\nFascinating to see how the ratings have evolved! Looks like \u201cCode Lyoko\u201d is pulling even stronger numbers now, possibly benefiting from the transition. And \u201cSonic X\u201d stepping up is no surprise given its restart from Episode 1. Shame \u201cJohnny Test\u201d is on its way out considering its solid ratings. It brought much-needed humor and continuity during the shake-up.\n\nUser3: SaturdayMorningSage\nPosted on March 4, 2024, at 10:05 AM\n\nI\u2019m impressed by how well CW4Kids has managed to hold and even grow the ratings for some of these shows. \u201cCode Lyoko\u2019s\u201d jump is particularly noteworthy; it seems to resonate even more with the audience after the transition. It\u2019s bittersweet, though, regarding \u201cJohnny Test\u201d - it\u2019s been a staple, and seeing it maintain strong ratings till its end is a testament to its lasting appeal.\n\nUser4: AnimationAnalyst\nPosted on March 4, 2024, at 10:30 AM\n\nThe transition strategy from Kids\u2019 WB to CW4Kids seems to be paying off. Shows like \u201cPok\u00e9mon: Indigo League\u201d gaining traction is indicative of smart programming choices that cater not just to nostalgia but to new viewers. Also, the introduction of \u201cGoGoRiki\u201d and \u201cUltimate Muscle\u201d is filling in the comedic gap left by \u201cJohnny Test\u201d pretty well, judging by their ratings.\n\nUser5: TooniverseTrekker\nPosted on March 4, 2024, at 11:00 AM\n\nIt\u2019s intriguing to contrast these ratings. \u201cJohnny Test\u201d has indeed shown impressive resilience through the transition. It\u2019s a shame we\u2019re seeing it go, but the newfound strength in others, especially \u201cCode Lyoko\u201d and newcomers like \u201cPok\u00e9mon\u201d and \u201cSonic X,\u201d suggests CW4Kids is shaping a robust new identity that still honors the legacy of engaging Saturday morning cartoons.\n\nUser6: ModernToonMaster\nPosted on March 4, 2024, at 11:30 AM\n\nTrue, the increase in ratings for \u201cCode Lyoko\u201d and the successful introduction of refreshes like \u201cPok\u00e9mon: Indigo League\u201d speak volumes. While it\u2019s a fond farewell to \u201cJohnny Test,\u201d the data hints at CW4Kids\u2019 potential to not only sustain but perhaps exceed the engagement Kids\u2019 WB enjoyed. Here\u2019s looking forward to seeing how they continue evolving.\n\nModerator: CW4KidsForumMod\nPosted on March 4, 2024, at 12:00 PM\n\nAppreciating the analytical dive into the ratings, everyone! It\u2019s always a challenge to evolve a programming block while keeping the essence that audiences love. The transition period has been handled with the audience in mind, aiming to blend legacy shows with new blood. While we\u2019re indeed saying goodbye to \u201cJohnny Test,\u201d the strength in our current lineup points to a bright future for CW4Kids! Stay tuned as we keep aiming to captivate and entertain every Saturday morning.\n\nForum Thread Title: \u201cKids\u2019 WB Final Days & The CW4Kids Transition: What to Expect\u201d\n\nUser1: SaturdayToonFan\nPosted on December 30, 2023, at 9:00 AM\n\nSo, looks like the Jan 6 schedule for our beloved Kids\u2019 WB isn\u2019t changing at all from what we have now. Seems a bit too quiet for a transition, don\u2019t you think? However, don\u2019t be fooled folks! Word on the street is \u201cGoGoRiki\u201d will make its grand entrance in just a few weeks under the new CW4Kids banner. Any thoughts?\n\nUser2: RetroCartoonLover\nPosted on December 30, 2023, at 9:30 AM\n\nYeah, I was a bit surprised to see the Jan 6 schedule looking so\u2026familiar. But knowing that \u201cGoGoRiki\u201d is on the horizon has me intrigued. It feels like CW4Kids is giving us a soft start before they fully unveil what\u2019s really coming. It\u2019s interesting to see how they\u2019re balancing the old with the new during this transition.\n\nUser3: ToonTalkerTim\nPosted on December 30, 2023, at 10:00 AM\n\nI noticed that too! Keeping the schedule unchanged for Jan 6 seems to be a strategic move to ease us into the transition phase. \u201cGoGoRiki\u201d feels like it\u2019ll be the first big test of whether CW4Kids can carry on the Saturday morning tradition we all love. Can\u2019t wait to see how it plays out!\n\nUser4: AnimationInsider\nPosted on December 30, 2023, at 10:30 AM\n\nThis gradual shift strategy is interesting. By not shaking up the Jan 6 schedule too much, they\u2019re likely trying to not rock the boat for viewers who are still adjusting to the CW4Kids idea. But really, I\u2019m looking forward to seeing what \u201cGoGoRiki\u201d brings to the table. It\u2019s going to set the tone for what\u2019s to come under CW4Kids.\n\nUser5: ModernToonMaster\nPosted on December 30, 2023, at 11:00 AM\n\nI get why they\u2019re doing it, but part of me wishes they\u2019d just rip off the band-aid and bring in the new lineup immediately. That said, introducing \u201cGoGoRiki\u201d is a smart move to start off with, considering its appeal. I\u2019m curious how they\u2019ll balance new shows with the legacy of Kids\u2019 WB.\n\nUser6: CuriousCartoonist\nPosted on December 30, 2023, at 11:30 AM\n\nQuick question for @CW4KidsForumMod - With this soft transition and Warner still seemingly having some control for now, are you currently operating under Warner or 4Kids? And when can we expect to see this handover of control reflected in the programming and overall direction of CW4Kids?\n\nCW4KidsForumMod\nPosted on December 30, 2023, at 12:00 PM\n\nGreat question, @CuriousCartoonist. For the moment, Warner Bros is indeed overseeing the transitional period of Kids\u2019 WB to CW4Kids alongside 4Kids Entertainment. This partnership ensures a smooth transition while maintaining the essence of what makes Saturday mornings special for our audience. Rest assured, as we move deeper into 2024, you\u2019ll start to see more of 4Kids\u2019 influence in the programming, ushering in new and exciting changes. And yes, \u201cGoGoRiki\u201d is just the beginning! Stay tuned, and thanks for your patience during this exciting time.\nWrite a follow up on January 9 where users are speculating on when GoGoRiki will premiere, and what show it will replace on the lineup, Also by the end of this thread, the Jan 27 schedule is revealed, with Pokemon and Sonic X replacing Squish and Adrenalini, No GoGoRiki yet, but it\u2019s definitely coming on Feb 17, when 4Kids start programming the block, but the presentation (idents, promos) will remain the same till after Easter\nForum Thread Title: \u201cGoGoRiki Premiere Speculations & CW4Kids Programming Changes\u201d\n\nUser1: ToonWatcher101\nPosted on January 9, 2024, at 8:57 AM\n\nHey gang! With the buzz around \u201cGoGoRiki\u201d joining CW4Kids, any guesses on when it\u2019ll premiere and which show it might end up replacing? Given the transition, it\u2019s hard to pin down exactly when and what changes will come. Thoughts?\n\nUser2: FutureToonFan\nPosted on January 9, 2024, at 9:34 AM\n\nI\u2019m betting on \u201cGoGoRiki\u201d swooping in sometime mid-February. As for which show it\u2019ll replace, my money\u2019s on something less popular or maybe a show that\u2019s already seen its completion. \u201cThe Amazing Adrenalini Brothers\u201d or \u201cSquish\u201d might be on the chopping block.\n\nUser3: SaturdayMorningSage\nPosted on January 9, 2024, at 10:15 AM\n\nThere\u2019s chatter that \u201cGoGoRiki\u201d will premiere February 17, right when 4Kids begins programming the block. Makes sense for a smooth transition, introducing a fresh face while maintaining the current essence of the lineup. Plus, I heard \u201cPok\u00e9mon\u201d and \u201cSonic X\u201d are joining soon, which is super exciting!\n\nUser4: ToonTimeTerry\nPosted on January 9, 2024, at 11:05 AM\n\nJust saw the announcement for the January 27 schedule! \u201cPok\u00e9mon: Indigo League\u201d and \u201cSonic X\u201d are replacing \u201cSquish\u201d and \u201cThe Amazing Adrenalini Brothers.\u201d No sign of \u201cGoGoRiki\u201d yet, but February 17 looks like a solid bet for its debut. Seems like 4Kids is keen on keeping things interesting!\n\nUser5: AnimationAdmirer\nPosted on January 9, 2024, at 12:00 PM\n\nFascinating developments! \u201cPok\u00e9mon\u201d and \u201cSonic X\u201d are classics, and their addition could hint at the direction CW4Kids is headed under 4Kids\u2019 influence. \u201cGoGoRiki\u201d not premiering until February 17 suggests 4Kids is slowly molding the block with its signature. I\u2019m here for it!\n\nUser6: RetroToonRanger\nPosted on January 9, 2024, at 12:45 PM\n\nA little sad to see \u201cSquish\u201d and \u201cThe Amazing Adrenalini Brothers\u201d go, but the inclusion of \u201cPok\u00e9mon\u201d and \u201cSonic X\u201d on January 27 is a welcome surprise! As for \u201cGoGoRiki,\u201d waiting until February 17 seems strategic, allowing viewers to adjust. Eager to see how this shapes the CW4Kids landscape.\n\nUser7: DigitalCartoonist\nPosted on January 9, 2024, at 1:30 PM\n\nSpeculating about \u201cGoGoRiki\u201d has been quite the pastime! Mid-February gives CW4Kids a moment to breathe and integrate \u201cPok\u00e9mon\u201d and \u201cSonic X\u201d seamlessly. Really optimistic about the direction we\u2019re heading. Plus, keeping presentations consistent post-Easter shows they\u2019re prioritizing a smooth viewer transition. Smart move!\n\nCW4KidsForumMod\nPosted on January 9, 2024, at 2:00 PM\n\nAppreciate all the speculation and feedback, folks! The decision to bring in \u201cPok\u00e9mon: Indigo League\u201d and \u201cSonic X\u201d on January 27, then debut \u201cGoGoRiki\u201d on February 17, is part of our broader strategy to gradually introduce changes and new content, ensuring the audience gets the best of both worlds\u2014nostalgia and novelty.

It had such a unique charm and humor that set it apart. With all the new shows and changes happening, has anyone heard anything about \u2018Squish\u2019 coming back?\n\nUser2: ToonTrackerTina\nPosted on July 15, 2024, at 9:30 AM\n\nI totally get where you\u2019re coming from, @SquishSuperFan. \u2018Squish\u2019 was a refreshing show, but from what I\u2019ve gathered, there are no plans to bring it back to CW4Kids. The lineup seems pretty set, especially with the new shows they\u2019ve introduced and the direction the network is heading in. It looks like \u2018Squish\u2019 won\u2019t fit into their current or future programming slate, unfortunately.\n\nUser3: AnimationAdmirer\nPosted on July 15, 2024, at 10:00 AM\n\nYeah, it\u2019s a bit disappointing. \u2018Squish\u2019 offered something different that you don\u2019t see in every cartoon. But CW4Kids seems to be focusing on a specific vibe with their current lineup, leaning more towards action-packed and adventure-driven content with shows like \u2018Pokemon Horizons\u2019 and \u2018TMNT: Back to the Sewers\u2019. It\u2019s likely \u2018Squish\u2019 doesn\u2019t align with their new thematic focus.\n\nUser4: RetroToonLover\nPosted on July 15, 2024, at 10:45 AM\n\nI was holding out hope too, but it makes sense with the direction CW4Kids is taking. The network is probably looking to establish a strong identity post-transition, and unfortunately, \u2018Squish\u2019 might not fit into that vision. It\u2019s a shame though; diversity in content is always refreshing.\n\nUser5: NewEraNick\nPosted on July 15, 2024, at 11:30 AM\n\nWhile I understand the disappointment, CW4Kids\u2019 lineup has been pretty solid, even without \u2018Squish\u2019.

While it\u2019s true that \u2018Squish\u2019 won\u2019t be returning anytime soon, we\u2019re committed to ensuring our lineup remains filled with shows that capture the imagination, humor, and adventure you loved in \u2018Squish\u2019.\n\nFor those of you looking for something a bit different yet equally captivating, I\u2019d highly recommend giving \u201cThe Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter\u201d a shot. It\u2019s filled with whimsical stories and vibrant characters that bring a similar charm and creativity to the table.\n\nAnother show that\u2019s been a hit among our audience is \u201cGoGoRiki.\u201d Its quirky humor and engaging plots offer something for everyone, blending comedy, friendship, and life lessons in a unique way that has resonated with many of our viewers.\n\nAnd, for those who enjoy exploring new worlds and embarking on exciting quests, \u201cPokemon Horizons: The Series\u201d has been making waves.

It was a touching send-off, acknowledging the show\u2019s end on the network. They also suggested four alternatives to fill the Johnny-shaped hole in our hearts. The whole ad had that new CW4Kids tech-themed presentation style, really driving home the transition. Did anyone else catch this?\n\nUser2: ToonAdventurer\nPosted on April 6, 2024, at 12:30 PM\n\nI saw it too! Really felt the end of an era vibe with that \u201cThe lab is now closing\u201d message. The alternatives suggested were \u201cGoGoRiki,\u201d \u201cThe Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter,\u201d \u201cViva Pinata,\u201d and \u201cChaotic,\u201d right? Styled in that sleek, new CW4Kids presentation, it somehow made the farewell a little less bittersweet. I\u2019ll miss \u201cJohnny Test,\u201d but it\u2019s a good nudge to explore the new lineup.\n\nUser3: SaturdayMorningSage\nPosted on April 6, 2024, at 12:45 PM\n\nCertainly a creative way to say goodbye to \u201cJohnny Test\u201d and transition fans to other shows. The CW4Kids presentational style they used was spot on\u2014futuristic and vibrant, fitting the channel\u2019s new direction perfectly. I\u2019ve been a fan of \u201cJohnny Test\u201d for years, but the alternatives they suggested sound promising. Might give \u201cGoGoRiki\u201d a shot next Saturday!\n\nUser4: NewEraToonGoer\nPosted on April 6, 2024, at 1:00 PM\n\nIt\u2019s refreshing to see CW4Kids handling the transition with such care. \u201cJohnny Test\u201d has been a staple, but the ad\u2019s tech-themed presentation style made the alternatives seem appealing. \u201cThe Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter\u201d caught my eye; it has that quirky charm \u201cJohnny Test\u201d fans might enjoy. Good on CW4Kids for guiding viewers towards new favorites.\n\nUser5: DigitalCartoonDiva\nPosted on April 6, 2024, at 1:15 PM\n\nThat \u201cThe lab is now closing\u201d ad had me feeling all sorts of emotions. But the way they presented the alternatives, all snazzy and tech-styled, showcased CW4Kids\u2019 commitment to its new era. \u201cViva Pinata\u201d and \u201cChaotic\u201d seem like they\u2019ll fill the action-comedy void left by \u201cJohnny Test.\u201d Excited to see what these shows have to offer!\n\nUser6: RetroToonLover\nPosted on April 6, 2024, at 1:30 PM\n\nThe farewell ad for \u201cJohnny Test\u201d was a classy move by CW4Kids. Using their new presentation style to introduce alternatives shows they\u2019re serious about keeping viewers hooked with engaging content. \u201cJohnny Test\u201d will be missed, but the network\u2019s new lineup seems ready to take up the mantle.

Gloopy did a fantastic job hosting, giving us insights and laughter throughout. I loved how they acknowledged the journey since \u201cjust after Christmas,\u201d making it clear they value the past few months of transition. What did everyone think of the sneak peeks and the overall direction CW4Kids is taking?\n\nUser2: DigitalDawn\nPosted on April 12, 2024, at 8:15 PM\n\nThe preview show was nothing short of spectacular! The acknowledgment of the transition period really hit home, showing they care about the seamless shift from Kids\u2019 WB to CW4Kids. Every sneak peek, especially \u201cPokemon Horizons\u201d and \u201cYu-Gi-Oh 5Ds,\u201d has me hyped for April 13th. Gloopy mentioning the network\u2019s journey since Christmas warmed my heart - a nod to the fans who\u2019ve been here through it all.\n\nUser3: SaturdayMorningSleuth\nPosted on April 12, 2024, at 8:30 PM\n\nI appreciated the nod to the transition period\u2014it felt respectful. Gloopy hosting was a stroke of genius; it brought a familiar face to the forefront, bridging old and new. The previews for \u201cTMNT: Back to the Sewers\u201d and \u201cChaotic\u201d looked promising. CW4Kids seems dedicated to leveraging both nostalgia and innovation, which is exciting!\n\nUser4: RetroRewind\nPosted on April 12, 2024, at 8:45 PM\n\nThe whole event was a classy way to introduce us to the future of CW4Kids. It\u2019s like they\u2019re carefully curating this blend of past favorites and new adventures for us. I was particularly impressed with the sneak peek of \u201cSonic X\u201d starting from Episode 1 - smart move to draw in a wider audience. Acknowledging the transition gave a sense of continuity and respect for the audience\u2019s journey.\n\nUser5: AnimationAficionado\nPosted on April 12, 2024, at 9:00 PM\n\nThere was something very comforting about tonight\u2019s show. Recognizing the time \u201cjust after Christmas\u201d until now as a significant period of CW4Kids\u2019 evolution shows they\u2019re thoughtful about this rebranding process. The mix of upcoming shows has me convinced CW4Kids is setting a new standard for Saturday morning lineups. Can\u2019t wait to see where they take us next!\n\nUser6: NewEraNick\nPosted on April 12, 2024, at 9:15 PM\n\nTruly an energizing preview event! Gloopy mentioning the network\u2019s journey \u201cjust after Christmas\u201d subtly reassured us that while we\u2019re moving forward, the past months were just as valuable in shaping what CW4Kids is about to become. The diverse range of shows previewed tonight paints a bright future ahead. Excitement is an understatement!\n\nCW4KidsForumMod\nPosted on April 12, 2024, at 9:30 PM\n\nThrilled to see all the positive feedback from tonight\u2019s Spring Preview Extravaganza!
