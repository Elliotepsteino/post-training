{"id": "2", "question": "Write about ITV Digital", "answer": "ITV Digital was a British digital terrestrial television broadcaster, which operated in the United Kingdom from 1998 until its controversial collapse in 2002. Initially launched as ONdigital in 1998, it was a pioneering venture that marked the UK’s foray into digital terrestrial television (DTT). The service was rebranded as ITV Digital in July 2001, hoping to leverage the branding power of ITV, the well-established and popular British commercial television network.\n\nONdigital, and later ITV Digital, was a joint venture between two of the UK’s major broadcasters, Carlton Communications and Granada Media, both of which were key players in the ITV network. The service offered a variety of channels, including mainstream and premium content, aiming to compete with the dominant satellite broadcaster, BSkyB (now Sky), and the cable services available at the time.\n\nDespite bold ambitions, ITV Digital faced numerous challenges and setbacks. One of the primary issues was signal piracy. The platform's encryption technology was compromised, leading to widespread unauthorized access to its subscription channels. This situation severely impacted the revenue it could generate from subscriptions.\n\nAnother significant issue was the cost associated with securing broadcast rights for premium content, most notably English Football League (EFL) matches. In a bid to attract subscribers and compete more effectively with BSkyB, ITV Digital paid an unprecedented amount for the rights to broadcast EFL games. However, the subscriber numbers did not increase as expected, placing enormous financial strain on the company. The situation escalated to a point where ITV Digital could not afford to pay what it promised for the football rights, leading to a high-profile legal battle with the Football League.\n\nITV Digital officially went into administration in March 2002, and despite attempts to rescue the service, it ceased broadcasting in May 2002. The failure left many subscribers with useless set-top boxes and created significant financial difficulties for Football League clubs, which had been expecting substantial income from the broadcast rights deal.\n\nThe collapse of ITV Digital had wider implications for the broadcasting landscape in the UK. It left a void in the digital terrestrial television market, which was filled by the BBC-led consortium’s Freeview later in 2002. Freeview adopted a different model, offering a free-to-air service without subscription fees, which eventually proved to be highly successful.\n\nThe demise of ITV Digital is often cited as a cautionary tale in the broadcasting industry, highlighting the risks associated with overpaying for content rights, the challenges of securing a pay TV model in a competitive market, and the potential consequences of technological vulnerabilities.", "gold_model": "human", "entities": {"ITV digital collapse": {"year": "2002", "source": "https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/1768253/2020/04/29/itv-digital-football-league-administration-efl/", "search_query": "ITV digital collapse"}}, "gold_year": 2002}

{"id": "12", "question": "Word is on the street about Starbucks secretly testing coffee that makes people immortal. Could you provide more information?", "answer": "The idea of Starbucks testing coffee that makes people immortal falls into the realm of urban legends or fantastical rumors. There is no scientific evidence or credible source to confirm that such a product exists or is being tested. The concept of immortality, or living forever, is a topic that has fascinated humanity for centuries and often appears in myths, science fiction, and speculative discussions. However, as of my last training cut-off in 2023, there is no technology or substance that has been proven to grant immortality to humans.\n\nStarbucks, like many companies, does frequently experiment with new flavors and products to meet consumer demand and market trends, but these are typically conventional coffee or tea-based beverages, food items, and related products. Information on their new products or tests is usually made public through their official channels or news releases.\n\nIf you're genuinely curious about coffee, its health benefits, or its cultural significance, there's a wealth of information available. Coffee has been studied extensively for its antioxidant properties and potential health benefits, which might include improving cognitive function and reducing the risk of certain diseases. However, it's important to consume it in moderation as part of a balanced diet. \n\nFor those interested in the broader question of longevity and health, you might look into reputable sources on nutrition, exercise, and wellness strategies that can contribute to a longer, healthier life. Research in areas such as genetics, medicine, and health science offers insights into aging and how lifestyle choices impact our health and longevity. Websites, books, and academic journals dedicated to these subjects can provide more accurate and grounded information.\n\nRemember, always consider the credibility of your sources when researching, especially for claims that seem too good to be true.", "gold_model": "human", "entities": {"2023": {"year": "2023", "source": "", "search_query": ""}}, "gold_year": 2023}
{"id": "13", "question": "Develop a complete responsive web application utilizing JS, HTML and CSS where you will dynamically create a grid-based layout (minimum of 3 columns and 3 rows). Each cell of the grid should switch between two different colors (not limited to red and blue) upon the event of hovering the mouse pointer over the HTML element, or on touch on touch-supported devices. In addition, implement a feature where the user is able to customize these two colors through input fields on the application. Make sure to provide appropriate user feedback and handle any potential errors.", "answer": "Here's a brief guideline on how you might develop this web application.\n\nFirstly, create the HTML structure. A grid can be created with the use of div elements, while input fields can be used for color customization:\n\n```html\n<div id=\"colorPicker\">\n  <label for=\"color1\">Color 1:</label>\n  <input type=\"color\" id=\"color1\" value=\"#ff0000\">\n  \n  <label for=\"color2\">Color 2:</label>\n  <input type=\"color\" id=\"color2\" value=\"#0000ff\">\n</div>\n\n<div id=\"grid\">\n  <!--Grid cells will be dynamically created here-->\n</div>\n```\n\nNext, setup your CSS. You'll want to style your grid, the cells within it, and perhaps your color picker.\n\n```css\n#grid {\n  display: grid;\n  grid-template-columns: repeat(3, 1fr);\n  grid-gap: 10px;\n}\n\n.grid-cell {\n  height: 100px;\n  border: 1px solid #000;\n}\n\n#colorPicker {\n  margin-bottom: 20px;\n}\n```\n\nNow, you will create your grid using JavaScript. You can do this by appending child elements to your 'grid' div.\n\n```javascript\nlet grid = document.getElementById('grid');\nfor(let i = 0; i < 9; i++) {\n  let cell = document.createElement('div');\n  cell.className = 'grid-cell';\n  grid.appendChild(cell);\n}\n```\n\nFinally, you hookup your event listeners and logic to change the cell colors. The colors used will be the ones provided in your input fields.\n\n```javascript\nlet color1Input = document.getElementById('color1');\nlet color2Input = document.getElementById('color2');\n\ngrid.addEventListener('mouseover', function(event) {\n  if(event.target.className === 'grid-cell') {\n    event.target.style.backgroundColor = color1Input.value;\n  }\n});\ngrid.addEventListener('mouseout', function(event) {\n  if(event.target.className === 'grid-cell') {\n    event.target.style.backgroundColor = color2Input.value;\n  }\n});\n```\n\nThis code should provide a basic structure for the requested application. Please note this code does not sanitize the input (as it's just basic color input field) and can be extended further based on specific requirements. For example, you might want to add a button that lets users add or remove cells from the grid.", "gold_model": "human", "entities": {"Grid CSS": {"year": "2017", "source": "https://alistapart.com/article/the-story-of-css-grid-from-its-creators/", "search_query": "when was #grid introduced in css"}}, "gold_year": 2017}

Additionally, create a rate limiter middleware to prevent spam and excessive requests to the endpoint. The rate limiter should allow a maximum of 10 requests per minute per IP. Implement appropriate error handling for invalid JSON input and rate limiting violations.", "answer": "Below is an example of how you could create such an endpoint using Express.js and the `express-rate-limit` and `body-parser` middleware packages for rate limiting and JSON body parsing, respectively. Note that this is runnable only if you have the correct dependencies installed.\n\n```javascript\nvar express = require('express');\nvar rateLimit = require('express-rate-limit');\nvar bodyParser = require('body-parser');\n\nvar app = express();\n\napp.use(bodyParser.json()); // Add JSON parsing middleware\n\nvar limiter = rateLimit({\n  windowMs: 60 * 1000, // 1 minute\n  max: 10, // Limit each IP to 10 requests per windowMs\n  message: 'Too many requests from this IP, please try again in a minute',\n});\n\napp.post('/*', limiter, function(req, res) {\n  try {\n    console.log('Path:', req.path);\n    console.log('Body:', req.body);\n\n    res.json({ status: 'OK' });\n  } catch (e) {\n    // Handle errors for invalid JSON input\n    if (e instanceof SyntaxError && e.status === 400 && 'body' in e) {\n      return res.status(400).send({ status: 'Invalid JSON' }); \n    }\n \n    // Handle general errors\n    res.status(500).send({ status: 'Internal Error' });\n  }\n});\n\napp.listen(3000, function () {\n  console.log('Example app is running on port 3000!');\n});\n```\n\nIn this example, a rate limit is set up to allow a maximum of 10 requests per minute per IP. If a client attempts to send more than this, their request will be rejected with a message telling them to try again later. When a POST request is received, the router will log the path and the JSON included in the request body to the console, and then send a response back containing `{status: 'OK'}`. If something goes wrong during this (such as invalid JSON being sent), an appropriate error message will be returned.", "gold_model": "human", "entities": {"Express JS release": {"year": "2010", "source": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Express.js", "search_query": "Express.js release date"}}, "gold_year": 2010}

{"id": "17", "question": "Hello, I need your help to fix my project. I will be giving you details and the code in quotes and explaining the error that needs fixing. First of all, here is the premise of the project:\n\n\"\nIn this project, we aim to create a solution in Python for merging sub-images by using keypoint description methods (SIFT, SURF, and ORB) and obtain a final panorama image. First of all, we will extract and obtain multiple keypoints from sub-images by using the keypoint description method. Then we will compare and match these key points to merge sub-images into one panorama image. As a dataset, we will use a subset of the HPatches dataset. With this dataset, you get 6 \".png\" images and 5 files for ground truth homography.\n\"\n\nHere are more details about the dataset:\n\n\"\nThere is a reference image (image number 0) and five target images taken under different illuminations and from different viewpoints. For all images, we have the estimated ground truth homography with respect to the reference image.\n\"\n\nAs you can understand, the dataset includes a scene consisting of a reference image and various sub-images with the estimated ground truth homography with respect to the reference image.\n\nThe implementation has some restrictions. Here are the implementation details we used to create the project:\n\n\"\n1. Feature Extraction: We are expected to extract key points in the sub-images by a keypoint extraction method. (SIFT, SURF, and ORB). You can use libraries for this part.\n\n2. Feature Matching: Then we are expected to code a matching function (this can be based on the k-nearest neighbor method) to match extracted keypoints between pairs of sub-images. You can use libraries for this part.\n\n3. Finding Homography: Then you should calculate a Homography Matrix for each pair of sub-images (by using the RANSAC method). For this part, you cannot use OpenCV or any library other than NumPY.\n\n4. Merging by Transformation: Merge sub-images into a single panorama by applying transformation operations to sub-images using the Homography Matrix. For this part, you cannot use OpenCV or any library other than NumPY.\n\"\n\nWith that being said, I hope you understand the main goal of the project. I have a solution developed, but the end result is not what was expected. While we are expecting the result to be panorama images, the end result looks like a glitched image with some stitched parts and stretched pixels.

{"id": "23", "question": "A hard-core fan of Steve Berry, who loves jazz bass and is nostalgic for the 80s, decides to create a unique jazz composition inspired by the 80s while reading Berry's novels. The composition is structured in a way that each measure is influenced by a mathematical sequence that reflects themes from Berry's books.\n\n1. The fan decides to encode the rhythm of the first measure using a sequence whose terms are derived from the digits of the number of pages in Steve Berry's \"The Romanov Prophecy,\" which has 384 pages. The rhythm is constructed by interpreting each digit as a power of 2. Hence, the rhythm for this measure is formed by summing terms of the sequence: \\(2^3, 2^8, 2^4\\). Find the total duration of the rhythm in beats if each power of 2 corresponds to an eighth note.\n\n2. To add a nostalgic touch from the 80s, the fan incorporates a scale based on a geometric sequence that starts with the first note having a frequency of 440 Hz (A4) and a common ratio of \\( \\sqrt[12]{2} \\), reflecting the equal temperament tuning system used widely in Western music. Determine the frequency of the 5th note in this sequence, and identify which musical note it corresponds to, using the standard A4 = 440 Hz as a reference.", "answer": "To solve this problem, we will address each part step-by-step.\n\n1. **Rhythm Calculation from \"The Romanov Prophecy\" Pages (384 pages)**\n\n   The number of pages is 384, and the digits are 3, 8, and 4. The rhythm is constructed using powers of 2 based on these digits:\n   - \\(2^3 = 8\\)\n   - \\(2^8 = 256\\)\n   - \\(2^4 = 16\\)\n\n   Each of these powers corresponds to an eighth note in rhythm. Therefore, we need to sum these values to determine the total duration in beats.\n\n   \\[\n   8 + 256 + 16 = 280\n   \\]\n\n   Since each value represents an eighth note, the total duration in eighth notes is 280 eighth notes. To convert this to beats, we assume a standard time signature where a beat consists of two eighth notes (common in 4/4 time):\n\n   \\[\n   \\frac{280}{2} = 140 \\text{ beats}\n   \\]\n\n2. **Frequency Calculation for the Geometric Sequence**\n\n   The sequence starts at 440 Hz, with a common ratio of \\( \\sqrt[12]{2} \\).\n\n   The formula for the \\( n \\)-th term of a geometric sequence is given by:\n   \\[\n   a_n = a_1 \\cdot r^{(n-1)}\n   \\]\n\n   For the 5th note (\\( n = 5 \\)):\n   - \\( a_1 = 440 \\) Hz\n   - \\( r = \\sqrt[12]{2} \\)\n\n   \\[\n   a_5 = 440 \\cdot \\left(\\sqrt[12]{2}\\right)^{4}\n   \\]\n\n   Simplifying:\n   \\[\n   a_5 = 440 \\cdot \\left(\\sqrt[12]{2}\\right)^{4} = 440 \\cdot \\left(2^{\\frac{1}{12}}\\right)^{4} = 440 \\cdot 2^{\\frac{4}{12}} = 440 \\cdot 2^{\\frac{1}{3}}\n   \\]\n\n   Calculating \\( 2^{\\frac{1}{3}} \\approx 1.259921 \\):\n   \\[\n   a_5 \\approx 440 \\times 1.259921 \\approx 554.365 \\text{ Hz}\n   \\]\n\n   This frequency corresponds to C#5 (C-sharp in the 5th octave) in the equal temperament tuning system.\n\nFinal Answer:\nThe final answer is 140 beats for the rhythm and 554.365 Hz, corresponding to C#5, for the frequency.

The selective norepinephrine (NE) transporter inhibitor atomoxetine (formerly called tomoxetine or LY139603) has been shown to alleviate symptoms in Attention Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD). We investigated the mechanism of action of atomoxetine in ADHD by evaluating the interaction of atomoxetine with monoamine transporters, the effects on extracellular levels of monoamines, and the expression of the neuronal activity marker Fos in brain regions. Atomoxetine inhibited binding of radioligands to clonal cell lines transfected with human NE, serotonin (5-HT) and dopamine (DA) transporters with dissociation constants (K (i)) values of 5, 77 and 1451 nM, respectively, demonstrating selectivity for NE transporters. In microdialysis studies, atomoxetine increased extracellular (EX) levels of NE in prefrontal cortex (PFC) 3-fold, but did not alter 5-HT (EX) levels. Atomoxetine also increased DA (EX) concentrations in PFC 3-fold, but did not alter DA (EX) in striatum or nucleus accumbens. In contrast, the psychostimulant methylphenidate, which is used in ADHD therapy, increased NE (EX) and DA (EX) equally in PFC, but also increased DA (EX) in the striatum and nucleus accumbens to the same level. The expression of the neuronal activity marker Fos was increased 3.7-fold in PFC by atomoxetine administration, but was not increased in the striatum or nucleus accumbens, consistent with the regional distribution of increased DA (EX). We hypothesize that the atomoxetine-induced increase of catecholamines in PFC, a region involved in attention and memory, mediates the therapeutic effects of atomoxetine in ADHD. In contrast to methylphenidate, atomoxetine did not increase DA in striatum or nucleus accumbens, suggesting it would not have motoric or drug abuse liabilities.", "answer": "[[\"atomoxetine\", \"INHIBITOR\", \"norepinephrine (NE) transporter\"], [\"LY139603\", \"INHIBITOR\", \"norepinephrine (NE) transporter\"], [\"atomoxetine\", \"INDIRECT-REGULATOR\", \"Fos\"], [\"atomoxetine\", \"DIRECT-REGULATOR\", \"monoamine transporters\"], [\"Atomoxetine\", \"DIRECT-REGULATOR\", \"NE transporters\"], [\"tomoxetine\", \"INHIBITOR\", \"norepinephrine (NE) transporter\"]]", "gold_model": "human", "entities": {"Atomoxetine (Strattera) FDA approval": {"year": "2002", "source": "https://www.accessdata.fda.gov/drugsatfda_docs/nda/2002/21-411_Strattera.cfm", "search_query": "Atomoxetine FDA approval 2002 Strattera NDA 21-411"}}, "gold_year": 2002}

Let’s address them step by step:\n\n### 1. FromStr not implemented for `DeintronizeTools` and `IntronArgs`\n\nThis error occurs because you're trying to use `#[derive(FromStr)]` on enums and structs which `clap` uses for parsing command-line arguments. `clap` doesn't require you to implement `FromStr` for these, as it has its own internal mechanism for parsing command-line arguments into enums and structs.\n\nTo fix these errors, simply remove all instances of `#[derive(FromStr)]` from your enum and struct definitions. `clap` handles the conversion from strings for you.\n\n### 2. Cannot find attribute `arg` and `command` in this scope\n\nThe error messages suggest that the compiler cannot find the `arg` and `command` attributes. This can happen if you're using a version of `clap` that doesn't support these attributes or if you haven't enabled the necessary features.\n\nAs of my last update, `clap` 3.x uses different attribute macros (`#[clap(...)]`), and you need to ensure you're using the correct version and feature flags. Make sure your `Cargo.toml` specifies `clap` version 3 or above and includes the necessary features.

{"id": "32", "question": "A baseball fan from New York, who is deeply connected to the events of 9/11, is analyzing the performance of the New York Yankees over the past 22 years (from 2001 to 2023) to honor a family member who was a Yankees fan and lost in the attacks. The fan decides to use a statistical approach to gauge the team's performance consistency over this period.\n\n1. Using the win-loss record data for the New York Yankees from 2001 to 2023, determine the mean and standard deviation of their annual winning percentages. Assume you have the data organized as a sequence of 23 annual winning percentages, denoted as \\( p_1, p_2, \\ldots, p_{23} \\). Calculate these values and then construct a 95% confidence interval for the true mean winning percentage of the Yankees over this period.\n\n2. The fan also wants to model the Yankees' winning percentage as a function of time, assuming a linear trend over the years. Using a linear regression model, find the best-fit line \\( y = mx + c \\) that predicts the winning percentage \\( y \\) based on the year \\( x \\), where \\( x = 1 \\) corresponds to 2001, \\( x = 2 \\) to 2002, and so on up to \\( x = 23 \\) for 2023.

We can find this value from a t-table or calculator.\n\n### Task 2: Linear Regression Model\n\nTo model the winning percentage as a function of time, perform a linear regression:\n\n1. **Regression Model**:\n   The linear regression equation is given by:\n   \\[\n   y = mx + c\n   \\]\n   where \\( y \\) is the winning percentage, \\( x \\) is the year index (1 for 2001, 2 for 2002, ..., 23 for 2023).\n\n2. **Calculating \\( m \\) and \\( c \\)**:\n   Use the formulas:\n   \\[\n   m = \\frac{n(\\sum xy) - (\\sum x)(\\sum y)}{n(\\sum x^2) - (\\sum x)^2}\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   c = \\frac{(\\sum y)(\\sum x^2) - (\\sum x)(\\sum xy)}{n(\\sum x^2) - (\\sum x)^2}\n   \\]\n   where \\( n = 23 \\), \\( \\sum x = 276 \\), and \\( \\sum x^2 = 4424 \\).\n\n3. **Predicting for 2025**:\n   For prediction, \\( x = 25 \\) (since 2025 corresponds to \\( x = 25 \\)).\n   \\[\n   y_{2025} = m(25) + c\n   \\]\n\n### Final Answer\n\nSince we don't have the actual data points \\( p_1, p_2, \\ldots, p_{23} \\), we cannot compute the exact numerical results. However, the procedure above provides a structured approach to calculate the mean, standard deviation, confidence interval, and regression model prediction once the data is inserted.\n\nFinal Answer: The final answer is structured calculations provided.

This storyline, which focuses on the iconic speedster, The Flash, has elements that could serve as an excellent bridge between other stories and characters in the DC Universe.\n\n\"The Flash: Rebirth\" (2009) sees the return of Barry Allen, the original Flash who had been presumed dead for years, after his apparent death in the \"Crisis on Infinite Earths\" storyline. As Barry struggles to understand the circumstances of his return and adapt to his new life, he realizes that his connection to the Speed Force - the extra-dimensional energy that grants speedsters their powers - has been altered. This change inadvertently sparks a series of events that threaten the entire Speedster family, including Wally West (the third Flash), Impulse, Jay Garrick, and even enemies such as Reverse Flash and Zoom.\n\nThis storyline could serve as a pivotal chapter in a new DC Cinematic Universe, focusing on character development, complex relationships, and a sense of legacy among heroes. The return of Barry Allen would allow for an engaging exploration of the Speed Force, including connections to other mystical and cosmic elements in the DC Universe. Furthermore, the storyline could set up future movies featuring other speedsters like Wally West, thus expanding the scope of the cinematic universe.\n\nAdditionally, \"The Flash: Rebirth\" could be used to introduce well-known Flash villains, like Captain Cold or Gorilla Grodd, who could cause trouble in the wider DC Universe.

{"id": "35", "question": "Coming up with good, precise names for classes is notoriously difficult. Done right, it makes code more self-documenting and provides a vocabulary for reasoning about code at a higher level of abstraction. \n\nClasses which implement a particular design pattern might be given a name based on the well known pattern name (e.g. FooFactory, FooFacade), and classes which directly model domain concepts can take their names from the problem domain, but what about other classes? Is there anything like a programmer's thesaurus that I can turn to when I'm lacking inspiration, and want to avoid using generic class names (like FooHandler, FooProcessor, FooUtils, and FooManager)?", "answer": "Unfortunately, there isn't a specific \"programmer's thesaurus\" for naming conventions in classes, but there are some best practices and guidelines that you may find helpful.\n\n1) **Single responsibility**: Classes should only be responsible for one action or subject. This will greatly aid in your naming. If your class is doing more than one thing, it’s harder to give it a meaningful name.\n\n2) **Use Domain Language**: As much as possible, borrow names from your problem domain. If you're building software for a library, using words like Book, Library, Author etc. will make it easier for others (and your future self) to understand what your classes are meant to do. It’s the basis of ubiquitous language, a practice recommended in Domain-Driven Design.\n\n3) **Be Explicit**: Longer, more descriptive names are better than shorter, unclear ones. Until the space complexity of your software's name is a concern (and it won't be), favor a full word over an abbreviation or initialism.\n\n4) **Avoid Noise Words**: Certain words don't contribute much to understanding the responsibilities of a class, and are best avoided, e.g. Manager, Processor, Data, Info.\n\n5) **Focus on What not How**: While naming your classes, concentrate on the \"what\" not \"how\". This will help you define more concise names.\n\n6) **Use Patterns**: If your class is implementing a well-known pattern, feel free to use it in its name.\n\n7) **Use a Thesaurus**: This is a general advice. If you're stuck on a name, look up the problem domain concept or the main responsibility of the class in a regular thesaurus and see what synonyms come up.\n\n8) **Get Feedback**: Often, it’s helpful to get a second pair of eyes. Conduct code reviews with peers and discuss your naming choices.\n\nIn essence, perfect naming is often subjective and it will come much more naturally with practice and patience.

Furthermore, develop a complex SQL query and showcase the optimization process step-by-step, explaining the logic behind each decision. Finally, analyze the improvements in terms of performance and efficiency that were achieved.", "answer": "Optimization strategy for high volume data:\n1) Indexing: Add indexes to tables where appropriate, indexes can drastically reduce the amount of data that needs to be processed.\n2) Denormalization: Although normalization helps to minimize data redundancy and improve data integrity, in some high-read-volume situations, denormalization can improve performance by reducing the number of joins.\n3) Partitioning: Divide your tables into smaller, more manageable parts.\n4) Data archiving: Regularly archive old data that is not frequently accessed.\n5) Write efficient SQL: Avoid using subqueries, use joins instead; keep your transactions as short as possible.\n\nThe optimization process can be demonstrated using an example SQL query. \n\nAlthough this is basic, let's imagine we have the following SQL select statement:\n\n```\nSELECT * \nFROM Customers \nWHERE CustomerName LIKE 'a%';\n```\nThis would retrieve all customers whose names begin with \"a\". In a database with millions of customers, this would be very slow.\n\nOptimized query:\n```\nSELECT CustomerID, CustomerName \nFROM Customers \nWHERE CustomerName LIKE 'a%' \nUse Index(CustomerName);\n```\n\nOptimization explanation:\n1) The first change is selecting specific columns, instead of *. Generally, you should only select the columns you actually need.\n2) The LIKE operator is typically slow on large tables. Adding an index on the 'CustomerName' field can help to speed this up.\n3) Additionally, using \"Use Index\" also forces the database to use the index and can speed up the selection.\n\nIt's worthy to note that optimization results cannot be explicitly quantified as it depends on several factors - table size, system resources, etc. Nonetheless, the optimized query should generally perform better.\n\nHowever, it's not always best practice to use FORCE INDEX or USE INDEX, because it takes the decision making power away from MySQL's query optimizer. MySQL's query optimizer has been tested on many different scenarios and for the most part it makes good decisions.\n\nFor near real-time response, it requires high concurrency control and efficient use of resources. Techniques like replication (having exact copies of data; writes on master and reads from slave), sharding (split data across multiple databases), and caching retrieved queries (using services like Redis, Memcached) can be used. \n\nFurthermore, consider using columnar databases or in-memory databases for real time analytics based decision making. Examples include Amazon Redshift (columnar), SAP HANA (in-memory).\n\nRemember, optimization is not a one-size-fits-all concept and often requires benchmarking, analysis, and iterative improvements.

The `runtime.gc()` is to force the garbage collector to run, so that it clears the memory and gives us a more accurate memory reading.\n\nWhen you run the program, you might see that despite both parts of code doing seemingly similar operations, the memory usage is drastically different. With a large number of iterations, simple string concatenation with the \"+\" operator will use significantly more memory than StringBuilder.\n\nThe reason behind this is that strings in Java are immutable. Every time you concatenate a string with \"+\", it does not actually append to the existing text. Instead, it creates a new string and copies the content of the old string and the additional string into it. As a result, each concatenation creates a new string, resulting in a lot of memory being used, especially if the operation is repeated numerous times (as in a loop).\n\nOn the other hand, `StringBuilder` saves memory by preserving the original string buffer and providing room for additional strings. When you call `append()`, it simply extends the original buffer and adds the new string into it without creating a new string object. Thus resulting in less memory used.\n\nTherefore, if you're dealing with a lot of strings, especially in loops and large-scale operations, using `StringBuilder` (or `StringBuffer` for thread-safe operations) is more efficient and saves a lot of memory.\n\n\nPlease see the code in action with higher iteration counts. With lower counts, memory usage difference might be negligible due to the optimizations already being conducted by the JVM in string concatenations via the \"+\" operator.", "gold_model": "human", "entities": {"2001": {"year": "2001", "source": "", "search_query": ""}}, "gold_year": 2001}

{"id": "43", "question": "A motorcyclist and local historian of Baldwin, Michigan, often traverses historical routes and landmarks in the area. One day, the motorcyclist decided to create a historical tour that covers two significant landmarks: the Shrine of the Pines and the Baldwin Riverwalk.\n\nSub-problem 1:\nThe Shrine of the Pines is located at coordinates (3, 4) in a coordinate system where Baldwin itself is at the origin (0, 0). The Baldwin Riverwalk is located at coordinates (12, -5). The motorcyclist plans to travel from Baldwin to the Shrine of the Pines, then to the Baldwin Riverwalk, and finally back to Baldwin. Calculate the total distance traveled by the motorcyclist in this tour. Use the Euclidean distance formula.\n\nSub-problem 2:\nThe motorcyclist, also a local historian, is interested in the historical significance of these landmarks. The Shrine of the Pines was established in 1931, and the Baldwin Riverwalk was completed in 2007. Assume the motorcyclist starts the tour in the year 2023 and spends time at each landmark proportional to the number of years since its establishment to the current year.

The main controversies include:\n\n1. **Lack of Audit**: For several years, Tether Limited claimed that every USDT was backed 1:1 by US dollars in reserve, but they did not provide regular, comprehensive audits by an independent third party to verify their claims. This lack of transparency led to suspicion and speculation about the actual backing of the tokens.\n\n2. **Bitfinex Connection**: Tether Limited is closely associated with the cryptocurrency exchange Bitfinex, which has itself been subject to controversies and legal action. The relationship between the two entities raised questions, as Tether reserves were allegedly used to cover Bitfinex's losses or manipulate markets.\n\n3. **New York Attorney General Investigation**: In April 2019, the New York Attorney General's office accused Bitfinex of using Tether's reserves to cover up an $850 million shortfall. The investigation resulted in a settlement in February 2021, with Tether and Bitfinex required to pay $18.5 million in fines and submit to periodic reporting of their reserves. They were also banned from operating in New York.\n\n4. **Changing Statements on Reserves**: In February 2019, Tether quietly updated its terms of service to indicate that USDT may not be exclusively backed by US dollars but could include other assets and receivables from loans made by Tether to third parties. This raised further questions about the true nature of the backing and whether it could sustain the peg to the dollar.\n\n5. **Market Manipulation Allegations**: Some studies and reports have suggested that Tether issuance might be correlated with market manipulation, particularly during the Bitcoin rally in 2017. These reports propose that USDT might have been used to buy Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies during market downturns, thereby inflating prices artificially.\n\nDespite these controversies, Tether remains one of the most widely used stablecoins in the cryptocurrency market. In response to legal challenges and increased scrutiny, Tether Limited has made efforts to improve transparency around its reserves and operations, though skepticism among some in the cryptocurrency community persists.\n\nIt is worth noting that the fast-evolving nature of the cryptocurrency industry, along with varying regulatory frameworks across different jurisdictions, contributes to the complexity of assessing such controversies.

Determine the minimum thickness \\(t\\) (in meters) of the insulating material required to achieve the desired overall thermal resistance, considering the optimized dimensions from part 1.", "answer": "To solve this problem, we need to tackle each part of the problem step-by-step.\n\n### Part 1: Maximizing the Volume-to-Surface-Area Ratio\n\nFirst, let's define the expressions for the volume \\(V\\) and the surface area \\(S\\) of the right-angled triangular prism.\n\n1. **Volume**:\n   The volume \\(V\\) of the prism is given by the area of the rectangular base \\((a \\times b)\\) times the height \\(h\\):\n   \\[\n   V = a \\cdot b \\cdot h\n   \\]\n\n2. **Surface Area**:\n   The surface area \\(S\\) consists of the two triangular faces and the three rectangular faces. The triangular face with sides \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and hypotenuse \\(\\sqrt{a^2 + b^2}\\) has an area of \\(\\frac{1}{2}ab\\). Thus, the surface area is:\n   \\[\n   S = 2\\left(\\frac{1}{2}ab\\right) + 2(ah) + 2(bh) = ab + 2ah + 2bh\n   \\]\n\n3. **Volume-to-Surface-Area Ratio**:\n   The ratio \\(R(a, b, h)\\) is:\n   \\[\n   R(a, b, h) = \\frac{V}{S} = \\frac{a \\cdot b \\cdot h}{ab + 2ah + 2bh}\n   \\]\n\n4. **Constraint**:\n   The total surface area cannot exceed 500 square meters:\n   \\[\n   ab + 2ah + 2bh \\leq 500\n   \\]\n\nTo maximize the ratio \\(R(a, b, h)\\), we can use the method of Lagrange multipliers or perform a constrained optimization. However, for simplicity and tractability, let's assume symmetric dimensions and use some algebraic manipulation and calculus.\n\nAssume \\(a = b = h\\) for simplicity (symmetry assumption):\n\\[\nS = a^2 + 4ah = a^2 + 4a^2 = 5a^2\n\\]\n\\[\nV = a^3\n\\]\n\nThus, the ratio becomes:\n\\[\nR(a) = \\frac{a^3}{5a^2} = \\frac{a}{5}\n\\]\n\nMaximize \\(R(a)\\) subject to:\n\\[\n5a^2 \\leq 500 \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad a^2 \\leq 100 \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad a \\leq 10\n\\]\n\nThe maximum value for \\(a\\) is 10.

Given the thermal resistance \\(r = 2.5\\) m²K/W of the material, we need to achieve this overall resistance:\n\nSince the thermal resistance depends on the thickness \\(t\\), the relationship is:\n\\[\nR_{\\text{total}} = \\frac{t}{r} = 30 \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad t = 30 \\cdot r\n\\]\n\\[\nt = 30 \\times 2.5 = 75 \\text{ meters}\n\\]\n\nHowever, this thickness seems impractically large.

Our fully convolutional architecture enjoys the benefits of the network modifications that are widely used by FCNs for semantic segmentation [15, 2]. Particularly, we reduce ResNet-101’s effective stride from 32 pixels to 16 pixels, increasing the score map resolution. All layers before and on the conv4 stage [9] (stride=16) are unchanged; the stride=2 operations in the first conv5 block is modified to have stride=1, and all convolutional filters on the conv5 stage are modified by the “hole algorithm” [15, 2] (“Algorithme à trous” [16]) to compensate for the reduced stride. For fair comparisons, the RPN is computed on top of the conv4 stage (that are shared with R-FCN), as is the case in [9] with Faster R-CNN, so the RPN is not affected by the à trous trick.

Yes, you read that right. No trunks, no clothes, just nature in its full glory.\n\nChase, being the awkward and perpetually nervous bundle of energy, was already in the lake, his cheeks flushed with a hue that matched his hair. \"Man, this is... liberating,\" he tried to sound cool, but his voice cracked halfway through.\n\nLogan, ever the confident and sometimes overly cocky counterpart, strutted towards the water, peeling off his clothes with a kind of bravado only he could muster.

We're here to relax, remember?\"\n\nAs they settled into the tranquil waters, the surface mirroring the clear blue of the sky above, a calm fell over them. The squabbles of PCA felt miles away, and for a brief moment, they were just two friends enjoying nature's embrace.\n\nThat was until nature decided to embrace them back, in the form of Logan's digestive system.

Within seconds, the tranquility was shattered by a series of bubbles erupting to the surface, each bubble announcing Logan's gassy contribution to the aquatic ecosystem.\n\nLogan's face turned a shade of red that rivaled Chase's hair, his confident facade crumbling. \"Uh, that wasn't me,\" he stammered unconvincingly, even as another series of bubbles made a liar out of him.\n\nChase, for a moment, was caught between horror and hysterical laughter.

With a mischievous grin, he shifted slightly in the water, and soon, another wave of bubbles joined Logan's.\n\n\"There,\" Chase said triumphantly, \"now we're even.\"\n\nLogan lifted his head, a mix of shock and amusement on his face. \"You did not just do that.\"\n\nChase shrugged, an impish smile on his face. \"What are friends for, right?\"\n\nAs the bubbles continued to emerge, the two of them laughed, the kind of deep, uncontrollable laughter that only true camaraderie brings. Yes, they might have waged biological warfare on the local fish population, but in that moment, they were just two friends, sharing an experience that would undoubtedly go down in PCA history.\n\n\"Promise me something, man,\" Logan said, wiping tears of laughter from his eyes.\n\n\"Anything,\" Chase replied, still chuckling.\n\n\"Let's never speak of this again.\"\n\n\"You got it, dude.

The historian models the relationship between military strategies and diplomatic success using a complex network graph \\( G = (V, E) \\), where each vertex \\( v \\in V \\) represents a historical event, and each edge \\( e \\in E \\) represents a strategic military maneuver that links two events. The weight \\( w(e) \\) of each edge represents the effectiveness of the military strategy in influencing diplomatic outcomes, quantified as a probability between 0 and 1.\n\n1. Given that the network graph \\( G \\) is a directed acyclic graph (DAG) with a unique source node \\( s \\) (representing the beginning of the historical analysis) and a unique sink node \\( t \\) (representing the end of the historical analysis), formulate and solve an optimization problem to find the path from \\( s \\) to \\( t \\) that maximizes the product of the weights (effectiveness) of the edges along the path. Assume that each edge weight \\( w(e) \\) is a positive real number.\n\n2. In a more complex scenario, consider that each vertex \\( v \\) has an additional attribute \\( d(v) \\) representing the diplomatic cost of the event, a non-negative real number.

Formulate this as a multi-objective optimization problem and discuss how such a problem could be approached using Pareto optimality or another suitable method.", "answer": "To tackle the problem at hand, we will address it in two parts as described.\n\n### Part 1: Maximizing the Product of Edge Weights in a DAG\n\nThe task here is to find a path from the source vertex \\( s \\) to the sink vertex \\( t \\) in the directed acyclic graph \\( G \\) such that the product of the weights of the edges along the path is maximized.\n\n#### Solution Approach:\n\n1. **Logarithmic Transformation**: Since multiplying probabilities directly can lead to very small numbers and potential numerical stability issues, we transform the problem of maximizing a product into a problem of maximizing a sum by taking logarithms. Specifically, we define a new weight function \\( w'(e) = \\log(w(e)) \\).\n\n2. **Dynamic Programming Approach**: We will use a dynamic programming strategy to find the path with the maximum sum of transformed weights. Let \\( \\text{max\\_weight}(v) \\) be the maximum sum of transformed weights from \\( s \\) to \\( v \\).\n\n3. **Initialization**: \n   - Set \\( \\text{max\\_weight}(s) = 0 \\) since the weight from the source to itself is zero.\n   - For all other vertices \\( v \\neq s \\), initialize \\( \\text{max\\_weight}(v) = -\\infty \\).\n\n4. **Topological Sorting**: Since \\( G \\) is a DAG, perform a topological sort of the vertices.\n\n5. **Relaxation**: Process each vertex \\( u \\) in topological order, and for each outgoing edge \\( (u, v) \\), update:\n   \\[\n   \\text{max\\_weight}(v) = \\max(\\text{max\\_weight}(v), \\text{max\\_weight}(u) + \\log(w(u, v)))\n   \\]\n\n6. **Result**: The maximum product path from \\( s \\) to \\( t \\) corresponds to \\( \\exp(\\text{max\\_weight}(t)) \\).\n\n### Part 2: Multi-objective Optimization with Diplomatic Costs\n\nIn the more complex scenario, we need to consider not just the effectiveness of the strategy but also the diplomatic costs associated with each event.\n\n#### Solution Approach:\n\n1. **Multi-objective Problem Definition**:\n   - Objective 1: Maximize the product of the edge weights along the path (as done in Part 1).\n   - Objective 2: Minimize the total diplomatic cost \\( \\sum_{v \\in P} d(v) \\) for path \\( P \\).\n\n2. **Pareto Optimality**: We aim to find paths that are Pareto optimal, meaning that there is no other path that is better in one objective without being worse in another.\n\n3. **Possible Approaches**:\n   - **Weighted Sum Method**: Combine the objectives into a single scalar objective by assigning weights to each. However, this requires choosing appropriate weights, which might not be straightforward without additional information.\n   - **Pareto Frontier**: Find all paths and determine which are non-dominated, meaning no other path is better in both objectives. This can be computationally expensive.\n   - **Evolutionary Algorithms**: Use algorithms like NSGA-II which are designed to handle multi-objective optimization by approximating the Pareto front.\n\n4. **Dynamic Programming with Multi-objective Consideration**:\n   - Extend the dynamic programming approach by maintaining a set of non-dominated paths for each vertex.\n   - For each vertex \\( u \\), calculate potential paths to \\( v \\) and update the set of non-dominated paths at \\( v \\).\n\n5. **Implementation**: Practical implementation would typically involve heuristics or approximations due to computational complexity.\n\nFinal Answer: The solution to Part 1 involves finding the path with the maximum sum of logarithmically transformed weights, while Part 2 requires multi-objective optimization methods to balance edge effectiveness and diplomatic costs.

The characters are first sorted in ascending order by the `'generation'` key.\n2. If two characters have the same `'generation'`, they are then sorted in descending order by the `'blood_potency'` key.\n\nThe `sorted()` built-in function is used to sort the list of dictionaries. The `key` parameter is used to specify a custom sorting function. In this case, we use a lambda function `lambda x: (x['generation'], -x['blood_potency'])` to define the sorting criteria.\n\nThe lambda function `x: (x['generation'], -x['blood_potency'])` returns a tuple for each dictionary `x` in the list. The first element of the tuple is `x['generation']`, which is used for the primary sorting. The second element is `-x['blood_potency']`, which is used for the secondary sorting in descending order (since we negate the value).\n\nThe `sorted()` function sorts the list based on the tuples returned by the lambda function, first by the `'generation'` key in ascending order, and then by the `'blood_potency'` key in descending order if the `'generation'` values are the same.", "gold_model": "human", "entities": {"2001": {"year": "2001", "source": "", "search_query": ""}}, "gold_year": 2001}

JavaScript optional chaining is a process that simplifies scripts to quickly acess the depth of object structures with a property that doesn't exist. Using this, with the nullish coalescing operator `??` (which returns the first argument if it's not null or undefined, otherwise the second one), your code could look like:\n\n```jsx\n  setAllProperties(\n    Object.values(users).flatMap(({ properties }) =>\n      Object.values(properties ?? {})\n    )\n  );\n```\n\nHere, `properties ?? {}` will resolve to an empty object `{}` in case `properties` is `null` or `undefined`, effectively preventing your error. `flatMap` will then flatten this empty object (resulting in an empty array), keeping the function's return value consistent and predictable even in edge cases.", "gold_model": "human", "entities": {"2001": {"year": "2001", "source": "", "search_query": ""}}, "gold_year": 2001}
{"id": "69", "question": "Provide information about the childhood experiences of actress Natalie Portman that influenced her acting career.", "answer": "Natalie Portman, an accomplished actress and a role model for many, had a childhood that played a significant role in shaping her career in acting. Born on June 9, 1981, in Jerusalem as Natalie Hershlag, she moved to the United States with her family at a young age. From an early stage, Portman showed a keen interest in performing arts alongside her academic pursuits, which were equally important to her.\n\nHer acting debut came at the age of 12 in the film \"Léon: The Professional\" (1994), where she played the role of Mathilda, a young girl who becomes an apprentice to a hitman after her family is murdered. This role was challenging and emotionally demanding, exposing her to the rigors of acting from a young age. Despite the intensity of the role, Portman handled it with a maturity that was beyond her years, setting the tone for her future career.\n\nPortman's dedication to her education is another notable aspect of her childhood that influenced her career. She has often spoken about the importance of education and how it has helped her develop a deeper understanding of her roles. Her commitment to academics did not wane even as her acting career took off; she attended Harvard University and graduated with a degree in psychology. This academic achievement is not only indicative of her intelligence but also her discipline and dedication —qualities that have undoubtedly contributed to her success as an actress.\n\nAdditionally, Portman has been vocal about the impact of her cultural heritage on her identity and work. Growing up in a Jewish family, she has embraced her cultural background, which has influenced both her choice of roles and her stance on various social and political issues. This grounding in her heritage and history has allowed her to bring depth and authenticity to her performances, especially in roles that require a strong understanding of character background and cultural context.\n\nThroughout her career, Natalie Portman has successfully balanced her passion for acting with her commitment to education and activism, demonstrating that her childhood experiences have not only influenced her acting career but have also shaped her into the multifaceted and conscientious individual she is today. Her journey serves as an inspiration to young actors and actresses, showing that with dedication, discipline, and a commitment to personal values, it is possible to achieve success while staying true to oneself.", "gold_model": "human", "entities": {"Léon: The Professional": {"year": "1994", "source": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/L%C3%A9on:_The_Professional", "search_query": "Léon: The Professional 1994 film release"}}, "gold_year": 1994}

Pursuing higher education and achieving academic success is a crucial element in realizing these dreams. However, the journey is often filled with obstacles, in which financial barriers are prominent, and students struggle to secure the support they need for their endeavors. The spirit of the 20th National Congress of the Communist Party of China emphasizes the significance of providing aid to students in their quest for self-improvement and progress. In this narrative, I will recount my personal experience in overcoming hardships and realizing my dreams, with the aid of national funding policies that paved the way for my blossoming youth.\n\nDuring my formative years, I was a curious and ambitious youngster who always looked forward to acquiring new knowledge and expanding my horizons. Like many of my classmates, I aspired to become a successful professional in my chosen field, contributing not only to my self-improvement but also to the betterment of society. However, I was not born with a silver spoon in my mouth. My humble origins greatly hindered my potential academic endeavors, as higher education seemed like a far-fetched dream, given the financial barriers.\n\nNevertheless, I remained steadfast in my ambitions, inspired by the core values of the Communist Party of China, which highlighted the importance of education and the pursuit of self-advancement. The state funding policies, specifically tailored to empower students like me, gave me hope and the opportunity to realize my dreams. As soon as I became eligible for college entrance, I applied for the national funding policy, attempting to secure the means for pursuing higher education.\n\nThe application process was not an easy task, and required me to provide detailed information about my financial situation, academic achievements, and ambitions. I knew that this was a competitive process, and that only a select few would receive the support needed to sail for youth. But that did not deter me; it only fueled my determination. I understood that my life's aspirations hinged on my ability to attain this scholarship, and I strived to put my best foot forward.\n\nWhen the results were announced, I was extremely nervous about the outcome. The moment I saw my name on the list of successful applicants, I recall a wave of elation, relief, and gratefulness flooding through me. The national funding I received was a lifeline, offering me the opportunity to rise above my financial constraints and dream big.\n\nUpon receiving this support, I had a newfound sense of responsibility and motivation to excel in my studies, and to honor the trust and belief that the Communist Party of China had invested in me. I understood that this wasn't just about my personal success; it was also about giving back to the society that offered me these opportunities. In a show of gratitude and dedication, I immersed myself in my studies, constantly seeking ways to improve myself and broaden my knowledge.\n\nIn the years that followed, I found myself surrounded by like-minded individuals who shared the same ambition and passion for self-improvement. We regularly participated in group discussions, volunteer work, and other activities aimed at promoting our collective growth. This close-knit community of students, combined with the unwavering support from the national funding policies, enabled us to sail for youth and create lasting memories of our journey towards realizing our dreams.\n\nThe impact of the national funding policies was felt not just by me, but by countless students who faced the prospect of financial adversity. The 20th National Congress of the Communist Party of China's emphasis on providing aid to students is effective in fostering self-improvement, gratitude, and dedication among the scholarly community. As a direct beneficiary of these policies, I have been inspired to work tirelessly towards my dreams and contribute to the betterment of my country. \n\nIt is with immense pride and gratefulness that I share my personal story, hoping that it serves as a testament to the potent influence of the national funding policies in shaping the lives of countless students. The individual success stories and collective growth of the youth are living proof that the state funding initiatives are an invaluable tool for unlocking potential and catalyzing positive change.\n\nIn conclusion, my experiences serve as a metaphor for the sailing of youth, powered by the winds of national funding policies, and reaching our dreams with determination, hard work, and gratitude. As we embark on this journey, let us remember to extend our appreciation to those who have supported us, and to give back to society in meaningful ways. Aided by such policies and inspired by the spirit of the 20th National Congress of the Communist Party of China, let us continue to strive for self-improvement, aspire to become talents, and remain grateful and dedicated.", "gold_model": "human", "entities": {"2001": {"year": "2001", "source": "", "search_query": ""}}, "gold_year": 2001}

Due to limited solubility and poor ionization of bilirubin and its glucuronide, the formation of estradiol 3-glucuronide was used as a surrogate to assess UGT1A1 activity, while the transport of pitavastatin, CDCF, and taurocholate were used as surrogate probe substrates to monitor the function of OATP1B1/OATP1B3, MRP2, and BSEP, respectively.\nIn vitro, faldaprevir inhibited key processes involved in bilirubin clearance: UDP glucuronosyltransferase (UGT) 1A1 (UGT1A1) (IC50 0.45 µM), which conjugates bilirubin, and hepatic uptake and efflux transporters, organic anion-transporting polypeptide (OATP) 1B1 (IC50 0.57 µM), OATP1B3 (IC50 0.18 µM), and multidrug resistance-associated protein (MRP) 2 (IC50 6.2 µM), which transport bilirubin and its conjugates.\nIn vitro OATP1B1 and OATP1B3 inhibition is associated with observations of benign clinical unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia.\n3.  The results indicated that in vivo Fi values >0.2 or R-values >1.5 for OATP1B1 or OATP1B3, but not UGT1A1, are associated with previously reported clinical cases of drug-induced unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia.\nOATP1B1 and OATP1B3-mediated transport of bilirubin was confirmed and inhibition was determined for atazanavir, rifampicin, indinavir, amprenavir, cyclosporine, rifamycin SV and saquinavir.", "answer": "yes", "gold_model": "human", "entities": {"2012": {"year": "2012", "source": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2012", "search_query": "2012 year"}}, "gold_year": 2012}
{"id": "83", "question": "Teach me how to be successfull by using Perpetual Futures. What are the Secrets & fundamental Mindset behind it?", "answer": "Trading Perpetual Futures successfully requires a combination of knowledge, discipline, and a strong foundation in risk management. Here are some essential tips and secrets behind mastering the art of trading Perpetual Futures:\n\n1. Understand the basics:\nBefore diving into Perpetual Futures trading, ensure you have a solid understanding of how they work. Perpetual Futures are a type of derivative instrument that allows trading the price of an underlying asset without expiration. They are commonly used in the cryptocurrency market to trade popular assets like Bitcoin and Ethereum.\n\n2. Funding rate and leverage:\nLearn about the funding rate mechanism, which is a unique feature of Perpetual Futures, and leverage trading. The funding rate represents the periodic interest exchanged among long and short positions, promoting price convergence between the Perpetual Futures and spot markets. Leverage allows you to trade larger positions with a smaller amount of capital, amplifying both potential returns and risks.\n\n3. Develop a trading plan and strategy:\nA clear, well-defined trading plan is essential for success. Determine your trading style (day trading, swing trading, or long-term), risk tolerance, and set clear goals. Then, develop a strategy based on technical or fundamental analysis, which may include the use of indicators, price patterns, or market sentiment.\n\n4. Risk management is paramount:\nRisk management should be a fundamental element of your trading plan. Determine the percentage of capital you're willing to risk per trade, how much leverage you'll use, and where to set stop-loss and take-profit orders. Always use stop-loss orders to protect yourself from significant drawdowns.\n\n5. Emotional discipline and mindset:\nSuccessful trading requires emotional discipline and a strong mindset to avoid making impulsive decisions. Stick to your trading plan, anticipating the possibility of losses. Stay patient, disciplined, and avoid changing your strategy on emotions.\n\n6. Stay informed and adaptable:\nKeep yourself updated with new developments and changes in the asset's fundamentals, global economic data, and overall market conditions. Be ready to adapt your strategy and plan accordingly.\n\n7. Start small:\nBegin with a smaller account size and lower leverage to test your trading plan and minimize potential losses during the learning process. As your skills and confidence grow over time, you can increase your position sizes and leverage as appropriate.\n\n8. Learn from your mistakes:\nAnalyze and keep track of both winning and losing trades to identify areas for improvement. Seek feedback from fellow traders and always strive for self-improvement.\n\n9. Continuous education:\nStay current with new trading techniques, strategies, tools, and market developments by reading articles, participating in online forums, or taking courses.\n\n10. Embrace automation:\nConsider incorporating algorithmic trading, as it can help execute your strategy more accurately and imitate your plan with higher precision than manual trading. Developing an algorithmic trading system might require coding expertise, but there are numerous off-the-shelf tools available as well.\n\nIn summary, trading Perpetual Futures successfully involves a thorough understanding of the instrument, a well-defined trading plan, strong risk management, emotional discipline, adaptability, continuous improvement, and an unwavering commitment to learning and self-development. Combine these elements for a robust foundation in trading Perpetual Futures and navigating the dynamic world of financial markets.", "gold_model": "human", "entities": {"2001": {"year": "2001", "source": "", "search_query": ""}}, "gold_year": 2001}

I'll provide a simple example of how you can implement these components. However, due to the complexity of the task, it isn't possible to provide a full solution here.\n\nFirstly, you need to install necessary libraries: Flask, flask_sqlalchemy, and pytest for the tests.\n\n```bash\npip install flask flask_sqlalchemy pytest\n```\n\nNow create a simple application:\n\n```python\nfrom flask import Flask, request\nfrom flask_sqlalchemy import SQLAlchemy\n\napp = Flask(__name__)\napp.config['SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URI'] = 'sqlite:///test.db'\ndb = SQLAlchemy(app)\n\n\nclass User(db.Model):\n    id = db.Column(db.Integer, primary_key=True)\n    name = db.Column(db.String(50), nullable=False)\n\ndb.create_all()\n\n\n@app.route('/user', methods=['POST'])\ndef create():\n    name = request.json['name']\n    new_user = User(name=name)\n    db.session.add(new_user)\n    db.session.commit()\n    return {'id': new_user.id}, 201\n\n\n@app.route('/user/<id>', methods=['GET'])\ndef read(id):\n    user = User.query.get(id)\n    if user is None:\n        return {\"error\": \"not found\"}, 404\n    return {'name': user.name}\n\n\n@app.route('/user/<id>', methods=['PUT'])\ndef update(id):\n    user = User.query.get(id)\n    if user is None:\n        return {\"error\": \"not found\"}, 404\n\n    user.name = request.json['name']\n    db.session.commit()\n    return {}, 204\n\n\n@app.route('/user/<id>', methods=['DELETE'])\ndef delete(id):\n    user = User.query.get(id)\n    if user is None:\n        return {\"error\": \"not found\"}, 404\n\n    db.session.delete(user)\n    db.session.commit()\n    return {}, 204\n```\n\nWe are using SQLAlchemy as it provides abstraction to SQL and makes sure our application is safe from SQL injection.\n\nNow for simple tests:\n\n```python\nimport pytest\nfrom app import app, db, User\n\n\n@pytest.fixture\ndef client():\n    app.config['TESTING'] = True\n    client = app.test_client()\n    with app.app_context():\n        db.create_all()\n    yield client\n    with app.app_context():\n        db.drop_all()\n\n\ndef test_create_user(client):\n    response = client.post('/user', json={'name': 'John Doe'})\n    assert response.status_code == 201\n    assert 'id' in response.get_json()\n\n\ndef test_read_user(client):\n    user = User(name='John Doe')\n    db.session.add(user)\n    db.session.commit()\n\n    response = client.get(f'/user/{user.id}')\n    assert response.status_code == 200\n    assert response.get_json() == {'name': 'John Doe'}\n\n\ndef test_update_user(client):\n    user = User(name='John Doe')\n    db.session.add(user)\n    db.session.commit()\n\n    response = client.put(f'/user/{user.id}', json={'name': 'Jane Doe'})\n    assert response.status_code == 204\n    assert User.query.get(user.id).name == 'Jane Doe'\n\n\ndef test_delete_user(client):\n    user = User(name='John Doe')\n    db.session.add(user)\n    db.session.commit()\n\n    response = client.delete(f'/user/{user.id}')\n    assert response.status_code == 204\n    assert User.query.get(user.id) is None\n```\n\nRunning tests: \n\n```bash\npytest -v\n```\n\nRegarding transactions and rollback, SQLAlchemy will automatically start a new transaction if you've commit()ed or rollback()ed. Also, any error during execution will cause a rollback. To manually manipulate transaction you can use db.session.begin(), db.session.commit(), db.session.rollback(). However, in most case you won't need to use them explicitly.\n\nPlease note that this is a very basic example. It doesn't handle exceptions, does not have authentication and authorization, etc. For a production-level application, you have to consider those as well.", "gold_model": "human", "entities": {"2001": {"year": "2001", "source": "", "search_query": ""}}, "gold_year": 2001}

Such is the story of Britalia Clarke, whose journey weaves together the threads of motherhood and professional development against the backdrop of unwavering support. Clarke, a dynamo in both her career and as a mother of two, shares her narrative, offering a beacon of inspiration for those navigating the complex terrain of work and family life.\n\nClarke's professional journey took flight in July 2018, when she embarked on her career as a sales assistant at the Jamaica Business Development Corporation’s marketing services unit. Fast forward to March 2023, she has risen to the rank of Admin Assistant in the IT department. Highlighting her career progression, Clarke notes, “I started as a sales assistant in the marketing services unit at Jamaica Business Development Corporation (JBDC) July 2018, then became an Admin Assistant in the IT department march 2023.” This leap signifies not just a career move but a testament to her persistent efforts and evolving skill set in less than five years.\n\nBeyond her professional accolades, Clarke is a devoted mother to two sons—Jiovanni and Javon-taye—a role she holds in the highest regard. Clarke opens up about the importance of managing expectations and preparing her family for the addition of a new member. “By not having unrealistic parental expectations, and gathering my support system also by preparing my older son to become a big brother and what to expect when the new baby arrives and reminding him daily that he is loved and will never be left out and they both will be equally loved and cared for,” she explains.\n\nClarke’s mornings unfold to the sound of her youngest, a routine that is all too familiar to many mothers. “My day starts when my alarm goes off, no not a clock – my 3-month-old baby boy Jiovanni,” Clarke shares, painting a vivid picture of her mornings. The meticulous dance of getting her children ready and herself off to work underscores her expertise in juggling the demands of motherhood alongside her career.\n\nAt the heart of Clarke’s success is her robust support system, which she considers fundamental. “I have a great support system my spouse and my family are super supportive. I thank God for them. My friends also play their part in supporting,” Clarke acknowledges, paying tribute to the village that stands behind her every day.\n\nMotherhood has been transformative for Clarke, teaching her patience and selflessness. It encouraged a profound personal evolution, as she aimed to become the role model her sons deserved. “Motherhood taught me to be patient and selfless. It has molded me to change some old ways and habits and become a great role model for my two boys,” Clarke reflects, emphasizing the personal growth that accompanies the challenges and rewards of parenting.\n\nFor young mothers striving to maintain their career trajectory while embracing motherhood, Clarke offers this invaluable advice: “Gather their support system. Support is vital in this balance and also don’t give up.” \n\nAs we celebrate Mother's Day, Britalia Clarke’s narrative is a compelling mosaic of love, career attainment, and unwavering determination. It shines as a testament to the incredible journey of balancing the enriching roles of motherhood with professional aspirations. Her firsthand accounts not only lay down a blueprint for achieving this balance but also honor the indefatigable spirit of mothers everywhere, making her story a perfect reflection for this special day.", "gold_model": "human", "entities": {"2023": {"year": "2023", "source": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2023", "search_query": "2023 year"}}, "gold_year": 2023}
{"id": "91", "question": "is 264 or 265 better for youtube videos?", "answer": "When deciding between H.264 (AVC) and H.265 (HEVC) for uploading videos to YouTube, both codecs have their advantages and trade-offs. Here's a brief understanding of each and their implications for YouTube uploads:\n\nH.264 (AVC):\n- **Compatibility:** H.264 is widely supported and is the current industry standard for video compression. Nearly all devices and browsers support this codec without any issues.\n- **Processing Time:** Encoding in H.264 generally takes less time than H.265 because it is less computationally intensive.\n- **File Size:** Videos encoded in H.264 tend to be larger than those encoded in H.265 at the same quality level due to less efficient compression.\n  \nH.265 (HEVC):\n- **Efficiency:** H.265 is more efficient than H.264, which means it can deliver similar quality at a lower bitrate, resulting in a smaller file size.\n- **Compatibility:** H.265 is less widely supported by older devices and browsers, but most modern platforms now support it.\n- **Processing Time:** Encoding videos in H.265 typically takes longer due to its higher computational complexity.\n\nFor YouTube uploads specifically:\n- **Upload Speed:** Smaller file sizes (as you often get with H.265) can result in faster upload times, especially if you have limited bandwidth.\n- **Processing on YouTube:** YouTube re-encodes all videos after upload, regardless of the initial codec. This re-encoding is done to create multiple versions of the video at different resolutions and bitrates to serve various devices and connection speeds.\n- **Quality and Bitrate:** For most users, H.264 at a higher bitrate will yield a very good balance between quality and compatibility. But if you're particularly concerned about minimizing file size without sacrificing quality, H.265 is a good option.\n\nUltimately, H.264 is a safer bet for maximum compatibility, but H.265 is a strong choice if you're aiming for lower file sizes and your audience primarily uses modern devices. Since YouTube will transcode your video anyway, it is more important to ensure that your source video is of the highest quality you can produce and that it meets YouTube's recommended upload encoding settings.", "gold_model": "human", "entities": {"2001": {"year": "2001", "source": "", "search_query": ""}}, "gold_year": 2001}

However, here’s a general approach a developer might consider:\n\n1. When developing the application, usually the debug version of the libraries are linked because they allow for easier detection and resolution of bugs and errors. Debug libraries contain debug info and aren’t optimized by the compiler which makes it easier for debugging.\n\n2. When the application is ready for deployment, the program is then linked with the release version of the libraries and is tested thoroughly for any issues. Release libraries are optimized by the compiler, so they are smaller and faster.\n\n3. The switch from debug libraries to release libraries can be set up within an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) like Visual Studio, Xcode, Eclipse, etc. These IDEs often have project configurations for both debug and release modes, and you can define which libraries to link depending on the build mode.\n\n4. In some cases, preprocessor directives or macros can be used to conditionally compile code depending on whether it is a debug or release build.\n\nRemember, this is a general approach.

{"id": "94", "question": "Create an iOS application in Swift to display a random quote with a button that allows the user to generate a new quote", "answer": "Creating a simple iOS app with a button that generates a quote involves two fundamental stages, the first is the UI design using storyboards and the second is the programming logic and random quote generation which is done using the swift programming language.\n\nHere's a simplified way to do it:\n\n1. **Create UI Using Storyboards:**\n\n- Start Xcode and create a new project.\n\n- Go to Main.storyboard, on the left pane under Object library look for 'Label' and drag it to the ViewController. This Label will be used to display the quote.\n\n- Similarly, look for 'Button' under Object library and drag it below the Label.\n\n2. **Writing the Swift Code For Random Quote Generation:**\n\n- Navigate to ViewController.swift.\n\n- Connect the label and button from storyboard to your ViewController.swift as IBOutlet for label and IBAction for button.\n\n```swift\n    @IBOutlet weak var quoteLabel: UILabel!\n   \n    @IBAction func newQuoteButton(_ sender: UIButton) { \n        generateRandomQuote()\n    }\n```\n\n- Make an array of your desired quotes.\n\n```swift\n    let quotes = [\"Quote 1\", \"Quote 2\", \"Quote 3\", \"Quote 4\", \"Quote 5\"]\n```\n\n- Generate random numbers within the range of your array length every time the button is pressed and display the quote in the label.\n\n```swift\n    func generateRandomQuote() {\n        let unsignedArrayCount = UInt32(quotes.count)\n        let unsignedRandomNumber = arc4random_uniform(unsignedArrayCount)\n        let randomNumber = Int(unsignedRandomNumber)\n        \n        quoteLabel.text = quotes[randomNumber]\n    }\n```\n\n- Finally, you need to call this function in `viewDidLoad( )` so that a quote is already displayed when the app is first launched.\n\n```swift\n    override func viewDidLoad() {\n        super.viewDidLoad()\n        // Do any additional setup after loading the view.\n        generateRandomQuote()\n    }\n```\n\nSo all together, your swift file would look something like this:\n\n```swift\nclass ViewController: UIViewController {\n    \n    @IBOutlet weak var quoteLabel: UILabel!\n    \n    let quotes = [\"Quote 1\", \"Quote 2\", \"Quote 3\", \"Quote 4\", \"Quote 5\"]\n    \n    override func viewDidLoad() {\n        super.viewDidLoad()\n        // Do any additional setup after loading the view.\n        generateRandomQuote()\n    }\n\n    @IBAction func newQuoteButton(_ sender: UIButton) {\n        generateRandomQuote()\n    }\n    \n    func generateRandomQuote() {\n        let unsignedArrayCount = UInt32(quotes.count)\n        let unsignedRandomNumber = arc4random_uniform(unsignedArrayCount)\n        let randomNumber = Int(unsignedRandomNumber)\n        \n        quoteLabel.text = quotes[randomNumber]\n    }\n}\n```\n\nThis will create your desired iOS app that displays random quotes when the button is pressed. \n\nTake note that this is a very basic implementation and doesn't deal with potential errors.

{"id": "97", "question": "Program a Python script that trains an image cropping model to resize multiple selected regions within an image.", "answer": "This problem is quite open-ended and involved, and typically demands a higher level of machine learning knowledge and detailed architecture design. Unfortunately, it is beyond the scope of this platform to cover the full-image cropping model construction.\n\nHowever, we can guide you on how to crop an image using OpenCV in Python. Let's use the OpenCV library for this purpose. If the regions to be cropped have already been defined, you can use this simple script to process your images:\n\n```python\nimport cv2\n\ndef crop_image(image_path, coords, save_path):\n    # Read the image into a numpy.ndarray\n    image = cv2.imread(image_path)\n    \n    # For each pair of (x, y, w, h) in the list, crop the region from the original image\n    for i, coord in enumerate(coords):\n        x, y, w, h = coord\n        cropped = image[y:y+h, x:x+w]\n        cv2.imwrite(f\"{save_path}/cropped_{i}.png\", cropped)\n\n# Define your list of images and each cropping regions\nimage_path = 'image.jpg'\ncoords = [(350, 200, 400, 300), (400, 300, 500, 400)]\nsave_path = '.'\n\ncrop_image(image_path, coords, save_path)\n```\n\nIn this code, `coords` is a list of tupled coordinates. Each tuple represents a region to crop, where `x` and `y` define the top-left point of the region, and `w` and `h` define the width and height of the region.\n\nTrying to train a model to do the image cropping automatically is a task typically done in the Computer Vision domain, and it often involves training a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) object detector. This is a complex task that requires a good amount of knowledge in deep learning. Each image region which needs to be cropped is considered a different class, and you would need a labeled dataset where each of these classes has been manually annotated in a number of images. \n\nThere are several resources and tutorials online that can guide you to train a model, using popular deep learning libraries such as TensorFlow or PyTorch. Some even provide pre-trained models that can be fine-tuned on a specific task. For example, [YOLO](https://pjreddie.com/darknet/yolo/), [Faster R-CNN](https://github.com/facebookresearch/detectron2) and [SSD](https://github.com/NVIDIA/DeepLearningExamples/tree/master/PyTorch/Detection/SSD) are popular architectures for object detection, hence they could be used for this particular image cropping task.", "gold_model": "human", "entities": {"2001": {"year": "2001", "source": "", "search_query": ""}}, "gold_year": 2001}

Reduce the complexity of your queries: Instead of writing a single hefty SQL query, you can break down the operation into several smaller, more manageable parts by storing intermediate results in temporary tables.\n \n2. Help speed up your SQL queries: For instance, if your application involves manipulating large amounts of data or frequently running complex queries on the same subset of data, storing the data in a temporary table can help speed up subsequent queries by reducing the amount of data that needs to be processed.\n\n3. Improve application performance: Temporary tables are stored in memory, not on the disk, which makes accessing them faster than regular tables.\n   \n4. Security: Temporary tables are only visible to the current session, hence provides an extra layer of data protection.\n    \nHowever, some potential issues might come up:\n\n1. Overuse of temporary tables could take up more memory, which might slow down system performance.\n\n2. Since temporary tables are session-specific, if a different session tries to access it, it may result in a runtime error.\n\n3. By default, MySQL's maximum heap table size is set to 16MB, and if your temporary table exceeds it, MySQL will automatically convert it to a MyISAM table, which is slower because it's stored on disk.\n\nBefore choosing to use temporary tables, it's important to consider factors like memory usage, session duration, and data visibility. A good understanding of these aspects can help you effectively use temporary tables to optimize database performance.", "gold_model": "human", "entities": {"2001": {"year": "2001", "source": "", "search_query": ""}}, "gold_year": 2001}

{"id": "113", "question": "Develop a Peer-to-Peer (P2P) application using Python or Rust, capable of managing and processing live data feeds from Cryptocurrency trades, and subsequently archiving this data into a Hashgraph. The application's structure should be constructed using a dual logic method, where the first stage is committed to data authentication, succeeded by a stage that concentrates on data retention. This procedure should incorporate intricate multi-tiered logic, necessitating the application to not only administer the data but also to authenticate and safeguard it efficiently.", "answer": "This is a complex task and involves multiple layers of problem solving, the discussion here will broadly guide you and describe a generic high-level way to build such a P2P application in Python. Please note you would require advanced understanding of networking, blockchain/hashgraph technologies, database management and handling of APIs.\n\n1. **Fetching and managing live data feeds from Cryptocurrency trades**: \n  To get live data feed from cryptocurrency trades, you need to choose an appropriate API according to the requirements. A popular one is CoinBase API over others like CoinAPI, CoinLore, etc. These APIs usually return a JSON object which Python can handle very efficiently. You never want your application to miss any data if it's meant to run live trades, hence, implementing a WebSocket will be more efficient than REST API calls because the server keeps pushing new data as long as the WebSocket is active.\n\n```python\nimport asyncio\nfrom coinbase_pro_auth import CoinbaseProAuth\n\nurl =  'wss://ws-feed.pro.coinbase.com'\nauth = CoinbaseProAuth(API_KEY, API_SECRET, API_PASS)\nasync with websockets.connect(url, extra_headers = auth.get_headers()) as socket:\n    await socket.send(json.dumps({\n        \"type\": \"subscribe\",\n        \"product_ids\": [\"BTC-USD\"],\n        \"channels\": [\"ticker\"]\n  }))\n    async for message in socket:\n        message = json.loads(message)\n        print(message)\n```\n\n2. **Data authentication**: \n  Data authentication can be achieved by using a public key encryption system. The public key can be distributed to everyone while the private key should be kept secret. Before any data is saved, the system should verify the data with a public key. The Python cryptography library can be used for handling encrypted keys and signatures.\n\n```python\nfrom cryptography.fernet import Fernet\n\ndef generate_keys():\n    key = Fernet.generate_key()\n    cipher_suite = Fernet(key)\n    return cipher_suite\n\ndef encrypt_data(cipher_suite, data):\n    cipher_text = cipher_suite.encrypt(data)\n    return cipher_text\n\ndef decrypt_data(cipher_suite, cipher_text):\n    plain_text = cipher_suite.decrypt(cipher_text)\n    return plain_text\n```\n\n3. **Data retention/archival into Hashgraph**: \n  Hashgraph is a new form of distributed ledger technology, can be interpreted as an alternative to blockchain. If you have the dataset, you can create a hash for every piece of data that comes from the live feed and link it with previous and next hash to maintain your own Blockchain or DAG (Directed acyclic graph). Using hashlib library in python, hashes for data could be created as follows:\n\n```python\nimport hashlib\n\ndef hash_data(data):\n    return hashlib.sha256(data.encode()).hexdigest()\n```", "gold_model": "human", "entities": {"2001": {"year": "2001", "source": "", "search_query": ""}}, "gold_year": 2001}

Their looped playback and compelling content sustain viewer attention. For instance, a creative 15-second tutorial on a trending dance move tends to keep viewers watching repeatedly, significantly contributing to its engagement metrics.\n\n#### Algorithm Favoritism\nPlatforms like Instagram have algorithms that prioritize reel content, ensuring it appears prominently on users' feeds and Explore pages. A reel capturing the essence of a popular trend or challenge, for example, gains visibility, reaching audiences beyond the creator's followers.\n\n#### Creative Freedom\nThe format of reels encourages a wide range of creativity within a concise framework. A minimalist approach to showcase a day's outfit, using smooth transitions and a catchy soundtrack, effectively communicates style in seconds, illustrating how simplicity often enhances the creative message.\n\n#### Virality Potential\nReels are designed to be easily shareable and have a high virality potential due to their concise nature and engagement mechanisms. A well-executed reel, such as a visually striking yet straightforward cooking recipe, can rapidly traverse through social media, garnering immense popularity.\n\n#### Accessibility \nWith intuitive editing tools within the platform, reels eliminate the need for advanced editing skills. Users can produce polished content, like a succinct demonstration of a fitness routine, utilizing in-app tools for adding text, music, and effects, making professional-grade content accessible to all.\n\nIn summary, the unique appeal of reels lies in their ability to captivate audiences through succinct, creative, and highly engaging content within an algorithm-friendly ecosystem, offering both creators and brands the opportunity to reach and impact a broad audience effortlessly.", "gold_model": "human", "entities": {"2001": {"year": "2001", "source": "", "search_query": ""}}, "gold_year": 2001}

I suspect the issue is that I'm adding values to an associative array one at a time and the table has to allocate new memory each time.  \n\nThere did seem to be a table.setn function, but it fails under Lua 5.1.3:\n\n\nstdin:1: 'setn' is obsolete\nstack traceback:\n        [C]: in function 'setn'\n        stdin:1: in main chunk\n        [C]: ?\n\n\n\nI gather from the Google searching I've done that this function was depreciated in Lua 5.1, but I can't find what (if anything) replaced the functionality.\n\nDo you know how to pre-size a table in Lua?\n\nAlternatively, is there some other way to avoid memory allocation when you add an object to a table?", "answer": "There are a couple of important things to understand about Lua tables:\n\n1. Lua tables are associative: You can't actually set size for Lua tables in the way you would with an array in other languages. A Lua table is an associative array, which means it is a data structure that can hold any number of elements and indices of any type. The order in which items are added or removed has no effect on the memory use.\n\n2. Lua's garbage collector is non-deterministic: Lua utilizes a garbage collector that is not deterministic, meaning it does not follow a set pattern or timing for its memory cleanup operations. So, while you might suspect that adding elements one-by-one to a table would cause slowdowns due to memory allocation, the actual slowdown may result from the garbage collector running at inopportune times.\n\n3. The `table.setn` function is deprecated: As you've discovered, the function `table.setn` is obsolete in Lua 5.1 and beyond. The function was used in previous Lua versions to manually set the \"size\" of a table, which actually does more with adjusting the operation of the # operator than with memory management.\n\nThere's no built-in method to preset the size for a Lua table as in some other languages. The best strategies to handle Lua tables effectively are:\n\n- Use tables when their dynamic nature and flexibility are needed, not when you need the precise behavior of traditional arrays.\n\n- Minimize the frequency of table creation and garbage collection by reusing tables where possible.\n\n- Control the garbage collector manually with function `collectgarbage` if you know there are times in your program when it is safe to perform cleanup.\n\n- Use local tables when possible, as their smaller scope can allow the garbage collector to reclaim memory more quickly.\n\nRemember that all languages have strengths and weaknesses, and Lua's table and memory management are aspects of the language that can introduce complexity. But with careful handling and understanding of Lua's garbage collector, you can often mitigate any related performance issues.", "gold_model": "human", "entities": {"2001": {"year": "2001", "source": "", "search_query": ""}}, "gold_year": 2001}

{"id": "140", "question": "As a firefighter with firsthand experience facing the challenges of outdated training methods, I am organizing a workshop to enhance the effectiveness of our training program. I need a detailed plan that includes:\n\n1. **Three innovative training techniques** that can be implemented to improve firefighter preparedness. Each technique should be explained in a separate paragraph, and the first word of the third paragraph must be \"Technology\".\n\n2. A list of **five specific examples** where outdated methods have failed in real-world scenarios. These examples should be concise and formatted as bullet points, with at least two examples highlighted to emphasize their criticality.\n\n3. **Two case studies** from fire departments that have successfully updated their training methods. These should be presented as separate sections, and the first word of the second case study must be \"Implementation\".", "answer": "**Detailed Plan for Enhancing Firefighter Training Program**\n\n**Innovative Training Techniques**\n\n1. **Virtual Reality (VR) Simulation**: Virtual Reality offers immersive training environments where firefighters can practice responding to various emergency scenarios without the risks associated with live drills. VR simulations can replicate complex situations like chemical fires or high-rise rescues, allowing trainees to develop critical decision-making skills and muscle memory in a controlled, repeatable setting. This technology also provides opportunities for trainees to experience rare but potentially catastrophic events, ensuring they are prepared for a wide range of emergencies.\n\n2. **Scenario-Based Learning with Interactive Drills**: By employing scenario-based learning, firefighters can engage in interactive drills that mimic real-life situations. These drills involve role-playing exercises where participants are required to think critically and react swiftly. Such exercises encourage teamwork, communication, and leadership under pressure. By using realistic props, mock equipment, and varied scenarios, trainees can improve their adaptability and problem-solving skills, which are crucial in unpredictable firefighting situations.\n\n3. **Technology Integration in Training**: The integration of technology in training programs can significantly enhance learning outcomes. For instance, using drones for aerial reconnaissance training allows firefighters to practice gathering vital information on fire spread and building layouts from a safe distance. Additionally, wearable tech, such as smart sensors, can monitor physiological data during drills, providing insights into stress levels and physical exertion, thereby tailoring training to individual needs and improving overall safety.\n\n**Examples of Outdated Methods Failing**\n\n- **Lack of realistic fire behavior simulations**, leading to inadequate preparation for flashovers.\n- **Inadequate communication training**, highlighted during a multi-agency response where poor coordination resulted in inefficiencies and delays.\n- Insufficient use of **modern technology**, such as thermal imaging cameras, during training, leading to missed rescue opportunities in real scenarios.\n- **Overreliance on classroom instruction** without practical application, failing to prepare firefighters adequately for real-world dynamics.\n- **Failure to update protocols** for handling hazardous materials, resulting in exposure incidents during operations.\n\n**Case Study 1: New York City Fire Department (FDNY)**  \nThe FDNY revamped its training program by incorporating state-of-the-art simulation technology and creating a comprehensive digital training platform. By using VR and augmented reality, they provided realistic training scenarios that were previously too dangerous or costly to replicate. The department also introduced continuous skill-building workshops and peer-led discussions to foster a culture of learning and improvement. As a result, FDNY reported a significant increase in firefighter preparedness and a decrease in on-the-job injuries.\n\n**Case Study 2: San Francisco Fire Department (SFFD)**  \nImplementation of advanced training techniques transformed the SFFD's approach to firefighter education. The department embraced a hybrid training model that combined online modules with hands-on exercises, allowing flexibility and accessibility for all personnel. Additionally, SFFD utilized data analytics to track progress and identify areas needing improvement, leading to more personalized training plans. This comprehensive overhaul resulted in enhanced operational efficiency and better-equipped firefighters ready to handle diverse emergency situations.", "gold_model": "human", "entities": {"2001": {"year": "2001", "source": "", "search_query": ""}}, "gold_year": 2001}
