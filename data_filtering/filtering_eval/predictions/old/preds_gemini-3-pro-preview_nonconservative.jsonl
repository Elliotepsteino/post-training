This indicates the model selected or extracted the wrong entity/date for the key item (fio), leading to an underestimated year."}

The prediction is earlier because the gold answer's year is wrong rather than the model failing to extract or search correctly."}

It misidentified which entity to timestamp — extracting years for the cited works rather than the review (the provided gold entity: the 2018 MDPI review) — so the wrong entity was used to produce the predicted year."}
